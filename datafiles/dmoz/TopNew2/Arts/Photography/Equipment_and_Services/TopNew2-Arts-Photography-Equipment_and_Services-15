figure 5 put it all together how it works the stator vibrates as a current is applied , but does not rotate. the vibrations of the stator , combined with the pressure against the rotor , cause the resulting frictional forces to rotate the rotor , which turns the output ring , moving the elements and focusing the lens . figure 6 the output ring & transmission after the stator and rotor come the output ring. a motor is useless without some kind of transmission , and this is it. the black output ring contains three symmetrically positioned metallic rollers. it receives input from either the rotor or the manual focus ring , and then moves the focusing group at the front of the lens. if you take a close look at figure 1 , you can see the " transmission " from the output ring at the bottom to the focusing group at the top . figure 7 full time manual do n't leave home without it the output ring is sandwiched between the m-1 usm and the manual focus ring ( under mild pressure ) . either the usm rotor or the manual focus ring turns ( while the other remains stationary ) , rotating the three rollers , which move the output ring . the ft-m mechanism , like the usm assembly , is so amazingly simple . note : the l-1 motor does not have ft-m , but rather electronic manual focusing ( e-m ) figure 8 returning distance information it is very interesting to note that this lens is capable of returning distance information to the body. canon wo n't comment , but there is a pattern of contacts arranged under the usm rotor , directly behind the distance scale . removing the distance scale and motor , it is easy to see this. as the output ring and distance scale rotate , so does a set of contacts , completing the circuit. when the lens is focused and the distance changes , the pattern of the contacts is different. there is a unique pattern of the contacts for each distance capable of being returned . figure 9 emd electromagnetic diaphragm canon ef and ts-e lenses all use deformation stepping motors to control the aperture blades. the aperture is controlled by an electronic pulse , and the result is very quiet and precise operation. other than the initial signal , control over the aperture is handled entirely within the lens . as this picture shows , the 28-105 usm has a five bladed aperture. this is probably a fairly standard canon emd unit . figure 10 the photocoupler explained by chuck westfall if you look closely at figure 10 , you 'll notice a small mechanism positioned above a semi-circular strip. this is a photocoupler , in other words a device consisting of an led and a photo-transistor. the semi-circular strip is an encoder ring covered with alternating reflective and non-reflective strips . [ sw : the alternating strips are very small , i had to use my loupe ( see figure 12 ) to see them ] this assembly is used during the autofocus drive process as follows : 1. the user activates autofocus detection by activating sw-1 ( switch-1 ) . [ in other words , by pressing the shutter button halfway if cf4 is set to 0 for example. ] 2. assuming successful autofocus detection , the camera outputs a focus signal ( consisting of a discrete number of pulses and a directional signal ) to the lens through the electronic mount. the lens cpu translates the focus signal to a usm drive signal. the usm is driven in the direction determined by the af detection mechanism . 3. as the usm turns , the phototransistor of the photocoupler detects changes in the amount of light reflected from the led , which occur as the encoder ring moves. the phototransistor converts this data to pulse signals which are relayed to the lens cpu . 4. the cpu counts the pulses to determine when correct focus has been reached. when the correct focus is reached , the cpu stops the usm . figure 11 the weak link the part that broke this 28-105 usm was dropped from a relatively low altitude onto a hard surface. optically and mechanically , the lens seemed to be fine. however , there are three plastic tabs which basically hold the plastic barrel near the mount and distance scale onto the rest of the lens. those three plastic tabs shattered as shown in the picture , ruining an otherwise good lens. i have been told by a visitor to this site that even the higher quality zooms still have this same type of design ( although with more connection points ) . this person dropped a 28-70l , and it broke in a similar manner . the lens probably could have been fixed , but i was looking for something to take apart for this tour , and i was willing to pay for it . figure 12 what now ? it makes a good loupe ! near the 105mm setting , without the focusing groups , this part of the lens can focus on the plane directly in front of the metal barrell. fine focus adjustments can be made by zooming ( turning the black ring at the top ) . this is currently at the 28mm setting ; the rear element ( shown protruding on top ) is flush with rest of the lens at 105mm . the only drawback is that it does not cover the full frame. it does , however , have high magnification. i do n't know what the power is , but it is more than 8x . last modified webbot bot = " timestamp " s-type = " edited " s-format = " % m/ % d/ % y % i : % m % p " startspan 06/08/03 10 : 56 am webbot bot = " timestamp " endspan i-checksum = " 26535 " photographs š 1994-2003 steve weixel
