late fall 1999 , weather permitting the metropolitan museum of art will open an outdoor installation of sculptures by magdalena abakanowicz , one of the most startlingly innovative artists of our time , on may 1 , 1999. abakanowicz on the roof will feature a selection of figural works , including signature pieces as well as objects created during the past year that have never before been exhibited. they will be installed in the 10,000-square-foot open-air space of the iris and b. gerald cantor roof garden , located atop the lila acheson wallace wing. the cantor roof garden offers a spectacular view of central park and the new york city . the installation is made possible by the lita annenberg hazen charitable trust. among the works on view will be backward seated figures , a group of life-size bronze sculptures created in 1992-93. the work consists of 20 seated , headless torsos that are placed side by side with their backs to the viewer . about the artist abakanowicz 's story is both dramatic and tragic. born in 1930 to aristocratic polish parents , she was raised on a country estate east of warsaw. her early childhood was peaceful but lonely , as she was isolated from other children because of her social class. world war ii and its aftermath , however , brought horrific experiences to the family , as on a night in 1943 when a drunken german invader shot young magdalena 's mother before her eyes ( in consequence , her mother lost her hand ) . living in communist poland for her adolescence and most of her adult life , abakanowicz witnessed intensely destructive human behavior , and has created art that unflinchingly expresses the human condition . abakanowicz studied at warsaw 's academy of fine arts between 1950 and 1954. while many polish artists fled to the west after stalin 's death in 1953 , she remained , identifying the fate of her art with that of her nation. by the 1960s , she began to earn an international reputation as a sculptor with a series called abakans , monumental three-dimensional forms made out of materials woven with her unique technique. while her reputation grew , her search for new art continued. she soon began to use materials such as burlap and resin in unforeseen ways and created a group of figures that drew broad attention and evoked provocative cultural and political debate. she initiated a series of monumental sculptures in the 1980s using bronze , stone , wood , and iron , the best known of which are katarsis , incarnations , and hand-like trees . abakanowicz currently lives and works in warsaw. her creative output is represented in more than 60 museums and public collections around the world . abakanowicz on the roof is coordinated by lowery stokes sims , curator , and anne l. strauss , research associate , both in the department of 20th century art . refreshments sandwiches and beverage service  including espresso , cappuccino , iced tea , soft drinks , wine , and beer  are available at the cantor roof garden daily from 10 : 00 a.m. until closing . # # # january 11 , 1999 < div class = " image-container " > < img alt = " placeholder " src = " /content/img/placeholders/press-article-promo-video.jpg " > < /div > < p > nam congue quam sit amet tellus imperdiet interdum. ut metus nibh , sodales at laoreet ut , lacinia non lorem. integer tincidunt facilisis mi nec imperdiet. ut metus nibh , sodales at laoreet ut , lacinia non lorem. integer tincidunt facilisis mi nec imperdiet. nam congue quam sit amet tellus imperdiet interdum. < /p > press resources end main-container end wrapper google code for sitewide remarketing list
