[ 16 ] [ 27 ] he isolated himself from the outside world , keeping a small circle of friends and relatives. [ 30 ] yet the solitude played a negative role in his art career. by the mid-nineteenth century , russian art was moving from romanticism towards a distinct russian style of realism , while aivazovsky continued to paint romantic seascapes and attract heavy criticism.

[ 13 ] [ 24 ] after meeting aivazovsky in person , anton chekhov wrote a letter to his wife on 22 july 1888 describing him as follows : [ 12 ] “ aivazovsky himself is a hale and hearty old man of about seventy-five , looking like an insignificant armenian and an bishop ; he is full of a sense of his own importance , has soft hands and shakes your hand like a general. he 's not very bright , but he is a complex personality , worthy of a further study. in him alone there are combined a general , a bishop , an artist , an armenian , an naive old peasant , and an othello . ” aivazovsky 's gravestone in feodosia after traveling to paris with his wife , in 1892 he made a trip to the united states , visiting niagara falls in new york and washington d.c. [ 13 ] in 1896 , at 79 , aivazovsky was promoted to the rank of full privy councillor. [ 27 ] aivazovsky was deeply affected by the hamidian massacres that took place in the armenian-inhabited areas of the ottoman empire between 1894 and 1896. he painted a number of works on the subject such as the expulsion of the turkish ship , and the armenian massacres at trebizond . he threw the medals given to him by the ottoman sultan into the sea and told the turkish consul in feodosia : " tell your bloodthirsty master that i 've thrown away all the medals given to me , here are their ribbons , send it to him and if he wants , he can throw them into the seas painted by me. " [ 35 ] he created several painting on the events , such as the massacre of armenians in trebizond ( 1895 ) , lonely ship , night. tragedy in the sea of marmara ( 1897 ) . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] he spent his final years in feodosia where , " he supplied the town with water from his own estate , opened an art school , began the first archaeological excavations in the region and built a historical museum. due to his efforts a commercial port was established at feodosia and linked to the railway network " . [ 38 ] aivazovsky died on 19 april ( 2 may in new style ) 1900 in feodosia. [ 13 ] " in accordance with his wishes " , he was buried at the courtyard of st. sargis armenian church. [ 39 ] a white marble sarcophagus was made by italian sculptor լ . biogiolli in 1901. [ 40 ] a quote from movses khorenatsi 's history of armenia in classical armenian is engraved on his tombstone : մ ա հ կ ա ն ա ց ո ւ ծ ն ե ա լ ա ն մ ա հ զ ի ւ ր ն յ ի շ ա տ ա կ ե թ ո ղ ( mahkanatsu tsneal anmah ziurn yishatak yetogh ) , [ 41 ] which translates : " he was born a mortal , left an immortal legacy " [ 39 ] or " born as a mortal , left the immortal memory of himself " . [ 42 ] aivazovsky the artist [ edit ] the ninth wave ( 1850 ) is aivazovsky 's most famous work. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] during his sixty-year career , aivazovsky produced around 6,000 paintings [ 13 ] [ 24 ] [ 14 ] " of very different value [ ... ] there are masterpieces and there are very timid works " . [ 46 ] the vast majority of his works depict the sea. [ 47 ] he rarely drew dry-landscapes and created only a handful of portraits. [ 46 ] aivazovsky " never painted his pictures from nature , always from memory , and far away from the seaboard. " [ 48 ] " his artistic memory was legendary. he was able to reproduce what he had seen only for a very short time , without even drawing preliminary sketches. " [ 13 ] his " truth to nature amazed his contemporaries , particularly his ability to convey the effect of moving water and of reflected sun and moonlight. " [ 28 ] exhibitions [ edit ] he held fifty-five solo exhibitions ( an unprecedented number ) [ 49 ] over the course of his career. among the most notable were held in rome , naples and venice ( 1841 – 42 ) , paris ( 1843 , 1890 ) , amsterdam ( 1844 ) , moscow ( 1848 , 1851 , 1886 ) , sevastopol ( 1854 ) , tiflis ( 1868 ) , florence ( 1874 ) , st. petersburg ( 1875 , 1877 , 1886 , 1891 ) , frankfurt ( 1879 ) , stuttgart ( 1879 ) , london ( 1881 ) , berlin ( 1885 , 1890 ) , warsaw ( 1885 ) , constantinople ( 1888 ) , new york ( 1893 ) , chicago ( 1893 ) , san francisco ( 1893 ) . [ 27 ] he also " contributed to the exhibitions of the imperial academy of arts ( 1836 – 1900 ) , paris salon ( 1843 , 1879 ) , society of exhibitions of works of art ( 1876 – 83 ) , moscow society of lovers of the arts ( 1880 ) , pan-russian exhibitions in moscow ( 1882 ) and nizhny novgorod ( 1896 ) , world exhibitions in paris ( 1855 , 1867 , 1878 ) , london ( 1863 ) , munich ( 1879 ) and chicago ( 1893 ) and the international exhibitions in philadelphia ( 1876 ) , munich ( 1879 ) and berlin ( 1896 ) . " [ 27 ] the house in feodosia , where aivazovsky lived between 1845 and 1892. it is now an art gallery . style [ edit ] a primarily romantic painter , aivazovsky used some realistic elements. [ 50 ] aivazovsky " remained faithful to this movement [ romanticism ] all his life , even though he oriented his work toward the realist genre. " [ 15 ] his early works are influenced by his academy of arts teachers maxim vorobiev and sylvester shchedrin . [ 24 ] classic painters like salvator rosa , jacob isaacksz van ruisdael and claude lorrain contributed to aivazovsky 's individual process and style. [ 16 ] karl bryullov , best known for his the last day of pompeii , " played an important part in stimulating aivazovsky 's own creative development " . [ 28 ] [ 24 ] ayvazovsky 's best paintings in the 1840s – 1850s used a variety of colors and were both epic and romantic in theme. [ 16 ] " towards the 1850s the romantic features in aivazovsky  's work became increasingly pronounced. " [ 46 ] " his ninth wave , usually considered his masterpiece , seems to mark the transition between fantastic color of his earlier works , and the more truthful vision of the later years. " [ 51 ] by the 1870s , his paintings were dominated by delicate colors ; and in the last two decades of his life , aivazovsky created a series of silver-toned seascapes. [ 16 ] the distinct transition in russian art from romanticism to realism in the mid-nineteenth century left aivazovsky , who would always retain a romantic style , open to criticism. proposed reasons for his unwillingness or inability to change began with his location ; feodosia was a remote town in the huge russian empire , far from moscow and saint petersburg. his mindset and worldview were similarly considered old-fashioned , and did not correspond to the developments in russian art and culture. [ 30 ] vladimir stasov only accepted his early works , while alexandre benois wrote in his the history of russian painting in the 19th century that despite he was vorobiev 's student , aivazovsky stood apart from the general development of the russian landscape school. [ 30 ] " aivazovsky 's mature work is usually on a large scale and contains dramatic plots. during the later period in the artist ’ s creativity , his favorite themes depicted the romantic struggle between man and the elements in the form of the sea ( the rainbow , 1873 ) , and so-called " blue marines " ( the bay of naples in early morning , 1897 , disaster , 1898 ) and urban landscapes ( moonlit night on the bosphorus , 1894 ) .

[ 52 ] [ 30 ] he resumed the creation of armenian-related paintings in the 1880s : valley of mount ararat ( 1882 ) , ararat ( 1887 ) , descent of noah from ararat ( 1889 ) . [ 52 ] the unique valley of mount ararat contains aivazovksy 's signature in armenian : " aivazian " ( ա յ վ ա զ ե ա ն ) .

[ 53 ] his other themed works from this period include rare portraits of notable armenians , such as his brother archbishop gabriel aivazovsky ( 1882 ) , count mikhail loris-melikov ( 1888 ) , catholicos mkrtich khrimian ( 1895 ) , nakhichevan-on-don mayor а rutyun khalabyan and others. [ 52 ] [ 30 ] the baptism of armenians and oath before the battle of avarayr ( both 1892 ) depict the two single most memorable events of ancient armenia : the christianization of armenia via baptism of king tiridates iii ( early 4th century ) , and the battle of avarayr of 451.

[ 24 ] [ 15 ] [ 56 ] today , he is considered as one of the most prominent marine artists of the 19th century , [ 39 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] and , overall , one of the greatest marine artists in russia and the world. [ 11 ] [ 33 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] he was also one of the few russian artists to become famous outside russia. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] in 1898 , munsey 's magazine wrote that aivazovsky is " better known to the world at large than any other artist of his nationality , with the exception of the sensational verestchagin " . [ 66 ] aivazovsky is also considered " the most influential seascape painter in russian nineteenth-century art " . [ 67 ] " he was the first and for a long time the only representative of seascape painting as one of the subspecies of the landscape genre. all other artists who painted seascapes were either his own students or influenced by him. " [ 49 ] ivan kramskoi , one of the most prominent russian artists of the nineteenth century , praised him thus : " aivazovsky is — no matter who says what — a star of first magnitude , and not only in our [ country ] , but also in history of art in general. " [ 5 ] another russian painter , alexandre benois , suggested that " aivazovsky stands apart from the general history of the russian school of landscape painting. " [ 49 ] the state russian museum website continues , " it is hard to find another figure in the history of russian art enjoying the same popularity among amateur viewers and erudite professionals alike. " [ 49 ] in nineteenth-century russia , aivazovsky 's " name became a synonym for art and beauty. " the phrase " worthy of aivazovsky 's brush " " was the standard way of describing something ineffably lovely " . it was first used by anton chekhov in his 1897 play uncle vanya . [ 12 ] in response to marina timofeevna 's ( the old nurse ) query about the fight between ivan voynitsky ( " uncle vanya " ) and aleksandr serebryakov , ilya telegin says that it was " a sight ( alternatively translated as " scene " , [ 68 ] " subject " , [ 69 ] or " picture " ) [ 70 ] worthy of aivazovsky 's brush " ( с ю ж е т , д о с т о й н ы й к и с т и а й в а з о в с к о г о syuzhet , dostoyniy kisti ayvazovskovo ) . [ 71 ] aivazovsky has always been considered an armenian painter in his ancestral homeland [ 30 ] and virtually always referred to there by his original armenian name , hovhannes. [ 72 ] aivazovsky is highly regarded in armenia and his significance in armenian art is greatly valued. [ 52 ] he was the " most remarkable " armenian painter of the 19th century , [ 4 ] and the first ever armenian marine painter. [ 73 ] he was born outside armenia proper , and like his contemporaries , including gevorg bashinjaghian , panos terlemezian , and vardges sureniants , aivazovsky lived outside his homeland , drawing primary influences from european and russian schools of art. his creativity and viewpoint have been attributed to his uniquely armenian roots. according to sureniants , he sought to create a union which would have brought together all armenian artists around the world. [ 30 ] aivazovsky 's house in feodosia , where he had founded an art museum in 1880 , is open to this day as the aivazovsky national art gallery ( ru , uk ) . posthumous honors [ edit ] the statue of aivazovsky in yerevan , armenia monuments in ukraine , armenia and russia stand in aivazovsky 's memory. a statue of the artist can be found in front of the feodosia art gallery , his former home. a statues of aivazovsky and his brother gabriel is located in simferopol , crimea 's administrative center. [ 74 ] aivazovsky 's first statue in his ancestral homeland was unveiled in yerevan in 2003.
