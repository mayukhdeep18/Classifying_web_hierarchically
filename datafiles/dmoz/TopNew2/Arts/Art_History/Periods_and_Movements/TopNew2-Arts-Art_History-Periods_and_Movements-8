selection /selection begin rich-media burst ! code end burst code a bstract expressionism or abstract expressionism - a painting movement in which artists typically applied paint rapidly , and with force to their huge canvases in an effort to show feelings and emotions , painting gesturally , non- geometrically , sometimes applying paint with large brushes , sometimes dripping or even throwing it onto canvas. their work is characterized by a strong dependence on what appears to be accident and chance , but which is actually highly planned. some abstract expressionist artists were concerned with adopting a peaceful and mystical approach to a purely abstract image . usually there was no effort to represent subject matter. not all work was abstract , nor was all work expressive , but it was generally believed that the spontaneity of the artists ' approach to their work would draw from and release the creativity of their unconscious minds . the expressive method of painting was often considered as important as the painting itself . artists who painted in this style include hans hoffman ( german-american , 1880-1966 ) , adolph gottlieb ( american , 1903-1974 ) , mark rothko ( american , 1903-1970 ) , willem de kooning ( dutch-american , 1904-1997 ) , clyfford still ( american , 1904-1980 ) , barnett newman ( american , 1905-1970 ) , franz kline ( american , 1910-1962 ) ,

1915-1991 ) , sam francis ( american , 1923-1994 ) , and helen frankenthaler ( american , 1928- ) . abstract expressionism originated in the 1940s , and became popular in the 1950s . examples : listed
