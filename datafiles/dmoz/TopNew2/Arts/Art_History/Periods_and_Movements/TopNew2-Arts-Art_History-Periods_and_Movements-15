it appears to have served principally as accessory to sculpture . a rare example is the painting of geese from a tomb at meidum . religious beliefs of the era held that the happy posthumous existence of the dead depended on the continuation of all phases of their earthly life. the artist 's task was therefore to produce a statement of reality in the most durable materials at his command. tombs were decorated with domestic , military , hunting , and ceremonial scenes. entombed with the deceased were statues of him and of his servants and attendants , often shown at characteristic occupations . middle kingdom delicacy of craftsmanship paintings in the rock-cut tombs brick architecture in temples and pyramids - not survived time first obelisks erected at heliopolis by senusret 1 it was a new age of experiment and invention that grew out of the turbulence of the first intermediate period ( 2185-2055 bc ) . the forms of the old era were retained , but the unity of style was broken. increasing formalism was combined with a meticulous delicacy of craftsmanship. the paintings of the rock-cut tombs at beni hasan ( e.g. , slaves feeding oryxes and cat stalking ) are outstanding for freedom of draftsmanship. in sculpture the sensitive portraits of senusret 3 and amenemhet 3 are exceptional in egyptian art , which at all other times showed a reluctance to portray inner feeling . -2nd intermediate bronze introduced by hyksos minor arts developments in chariots and weapons . new kingdom emphasis is on bulk and solidity durable materials - sandstone , basalt and granite colossal statuary - impressive temples amarna revolution and counter-revolution this period can be viewed as the final development of the classic egyptian style of the middle era , a combination of the monumental forms of the old and the drive and inspiration of the middle. the paintings of this period are noted for boldness of design and controlled vitality. in sculpture the emphasis is on bulk , solidity , and impersonality . during the amarna era a free and delicate style developed with many naturalistic tendencies and a new sense of life and movement. in sculpture the new style was carried to the point of caricature , e.g. , in the colossal statue of akhenaten . the outstanding masterpiece of this period is the painted limestone bust of queen nefertiti ( berlin museum. ) . the delicacy , sophistication , and extreme richness of this style in its late stages is best exemplified by the furnishings from the tomb of tutankhamen . the ramsesside era ( 19th dynasty ) saw an attempt to return to the classic formalism of the earlier new kingdom , but the vitality that characterized that time could not be recovered. the sculpture , both in relief and in the round , became monotonous and even overbearing except in the numerous battle scenes . late kingdom imitation of old kingdom and middle kingdom structures minor arts pottery from nubia the kushite pharaohs of the 26th dynasty , with their conservative tastes for classical standards , wanted to return to the glory of the past , they thought to be the instigators of the antiquarian study of the past which is a feature of the following dynasties . there is a large amount of effort to recapture egypt 's splendor. much of the sculptures and art styles of this time appear to imitate the old kingdom and middle kingdom , and by the introduction of satirical and often cynical drawings in the papyri. minor arts continued to flourish , alabaster vases , faience pottery , glass , ivories , and metalwork were produced with the ancient skill and in the traditional egyptian style . ptolemaic period greek elements introduced - architectural public buildings boosting textiles , pottery and metal vessels industries glass and paper industries alexandria became a base of palaces and gardens , it gained fame in architecture . thanks to its famous pharos lighthouse which was considered by the hellenes among the seven wonders of the world . the colossal library of alexandria housed a million papyrus rolls . it was the tradition that every visiting scientist should present to alexandria a copy of his works ; hence , the number of books in the university reached more than 700,000 . the ptolemies a took interest in sports , building a gymnasium , a theater and a horse race track in alexandria . photos : egyptian art museum collections ashmolean treasures louvre petrie british cairo luxor top of page poll : after reviewing the photos of egyptian art in museum collections , which dynastic period in ancient egypt produced the most interesting and beautiful art forms ? answers : early and pre-dynastic period 5 % 8 votes old kingdom 9 % 14 votes middle kingdom 5 % 9 votes new kingdom 9 % 14 votes late period 2 % 4 votes ptolemaic period 3 % 6 votes none of the above , egyptian art is dull 3 % 6 votes dumb question 11 % 17 votes all periods have their character , and ca n't really decide 49 % 76 votes send vote : total votes : 154 top of page footer about & legal sitemap google + valid html5 by ayman fadl - copyright Â© 2001 -2014
