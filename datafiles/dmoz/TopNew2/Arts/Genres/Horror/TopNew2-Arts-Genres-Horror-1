" " danny , " he corrected me , while meeting my eye and shaking my hand. a wonderful moment for me. i only wish i could have interviewed him properly. god bless you , danny , and thank you for your contribution to the genre.

" hell , come to think of it , i tried to coin " re-accomplishment " for rob zombie 's halloween feature from last year ; it did n't catch on , incidentally. but patrick lussier 's my bloody valentine 3d , a fresh take on the feisty 1981 canadian slasher , is in a class of its own. and the stunning three-dimensional visuals are only a sidebar , not the mainstay of this winningly creepy horror romp. the film moves at a strikingly rapid clip. for a moment , i wondered if the projectionist had mistakenly put on the last reel , and this was about five minutes into the screening. but he had n't , because this film has a get-up-and-go agenda and wastes no time setting up a backstory and then engineering a fake-out second prologue. in the interest of exposition , the small mining township of harmony , pennsylvania suffers a terrible tragedy in which an inexperienced miner accidentally triggers a collapse which traps six miners. when the debris is finally cleared , only one miner is still alive. it is the comatose harry warden ( rich walters ) , but it 's quickly discovered that he used his pick-axe to murder the other five to conserve oxygen for himself....
