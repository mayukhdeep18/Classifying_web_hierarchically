well , they seem to think so. you ever tried to buy a new cover for your one + year old ikea sofa ? yep , me too. an empty stare from the ikea staff was all i got. fortunately there are people picking up this after-market over at bemz . and the covers are even _nicer_ than the original ones. they 'd have to be , because the ikea i know would not let anyone make money on their stuff if they could avoid it. i know a company that was supplying a product to ikea and suddenly ikea started to manufacture the exact same product and dropped the supplier like a hot potato. it was a very small company so a legal battle was probably out of the question. so , bemz beware. now you can bring your sofa when visiting the stockholm archipelago . posted by kenneth at 3/15/2006 06 : 54 : 00 pm | 2 comments end .post begin # comments end # comments 2006-02-26 begin .post watch tv while taking a shower sometimes you got ta go when...you got ta go. but do n't worry , there 's people in the world constantly working to meet your every need. you no longer have to miss a second of your favorite show. i 'm talking about tv in the bathroom ! now you can watch baywatch and shower at the same time. you 'll feel like you 're part of the action. or...you could just get a dvr and watch everything later , but hey , what 's the fun in that ?
