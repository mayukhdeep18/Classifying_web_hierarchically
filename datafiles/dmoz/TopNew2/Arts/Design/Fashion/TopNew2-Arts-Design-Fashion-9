trend of the 50s and 60s , the 70s and the 80s and 90s and here we are in 2014 and they are back in fashion. the trend of these shoes bright colours , clear complexions , and fun attitude are what is making these classics come back with a bang. sitting on the beach , strolling down the foreshore in itsy bitsy bikinis , licking icy poles and whatever else we all do over the summer has just become

plastishus plastic fisherman sandals in 1957. other manufacturers across europe , brazil and australia such as fashy , talisman and bata started production in the 50s with most examples now being produced in china to a poor standard , but cheap price. customers tend to purchase the cheap chinese brands in preference to the quality brands and then complain because the straps and buckles break and they get blisters from the poor quality plastic . click on pictures for full size or links to sites please sponsor a child in cambodia click on the photo above and search asos for jelly sandals
