" it is not surprising that this podcast wins all of the major broadcasting awards. i am happy to be sucked in to one of these gems every week. [ itunes ] [ thisamericanlife.org ] savage love ( about 30 – 45 minutes ) sex advice columnist , dan savage answers sex and relationship questions from callers. the show is funny , sexual , blunt and vulgar. the opening tune is " if you ’ re stuck in a relationship quandary or if you ’ re looking for sexual harmony , well , there ’ s nothing you can ’ t ask on the savage lovecast. " it took a few episodes before i started to really love this podcast , but now i am hooked. if i ever had a bad day , i listen to this podcast because it often makes me laugh-out-loud.

[ itunes ] [ rss ] onion radio news ( about 1 minute ) i love these sarcastic-funny episodes. unfortunately , my ipod/car dock setup does not allow me to cycle through episodes without undocking. these episodes are so short that it is rather inconvenient ( and probably dangerous ) for me to be docking/selecting/redocking/etc. i listen to this at a computer. if your set up allows you to shift through episodes , i highly recommend this one for a good laugh.

" ( © audiofile , 2006 ) this was the first audiobook i listened to and i was so completely hooked. [ audible ] [ itunes ] [ amazon ( cd ) ] when you are engulfed in flames ( 9 hours and 3 minutes ) by david sedaris narrated by : david sedaris i find david sedaris to be hilarious both in written and audiobook form. when you are engulfed in flames is the first author-read audiobook i have listened to by sedaris , and i found it so funny that i will go back and listen to all of his books that i have previously enjoyed reading. [ audible ] [ itunes ] [ amazon ( cd ) ] the devil wears prada ( 14 hours and 4 minutes ) by lauren weisberger narrated by bernadette dunne this is totally indulgent chick-lit at its finest. it made my commute seem so short. [ audible ] [ itunes ] the bedwetter : stories of courage , redemption , and pee ( 5 hours and 42 minutes ) by sarah silverman narrated by : sarah silverman i think this book is best delivered in audiobook format. it was full of snarky , self-deprecating humor. it is not as funny as sarah 's on-air comedy , but i still had a few lol moments so it was totally worth it.
