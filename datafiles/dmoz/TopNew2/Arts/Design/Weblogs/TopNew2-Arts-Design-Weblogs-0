( all images ikea ) . colour | green colour | yellow colour | blue colour | natural colour | pink creativity ikea explains , " to “ be creative ” is no longer an activity done in isolation , but rather a globally valued character trait that improves both our personal and professional lives. and in a computerized and sanitized world of screens and intangible elements , being creative with our hands and minds is becoming something we increasingly crave. something that allows us to express our personality , and feel some calm " . well-being | private rooms bedrooms and bathrooms are often down prioritized financially according to ikea. “ most people spend their money on “ public rooms ” – places like the kitchen and living room ; spaces where we socialize and invite people. they offer inspiration " for more functional , beautiful and sustainable solutions " for private rooms. see below : urbanization downsizing and smart space living are something as a society we 're focusing on. according to ikea , " for the first time in history , more people live in cities than in the countryside. in less than 20 years , 70 % of the world ’ s population will live in cities " . small spaces and accommodating indoor and deck gardening are just a few of the trends they are seeing , like below : visit ikea in the us for the 2015 catalogue using this link . and here for the canadian version ( mid august ) . all photos ikea usa . at 1 : 30 am 3 comments : labels : 2014 trends , 2015 ikea catalogue , ikea2015 google_ad_section_end ( name = default ) google_ad_section_start 3 best of recipes | rose buttercream cake tutorial guest post by lyndsay sung of coco cake land we thought we 'd pull out this gem for this weeks " best of " series because it 's pink day ( at our summer colours week ) and well , this is a sweet how-to from our friend lyndsay of coco cake land . check it out ! rose buttercream cake tutorial how lovely is a rosette buttercream covered cake ? i 've always loved the look of buttercream cakes - they have such a sweet and vintage feel about them. i wanted to try making a rosette covered cake , similar to the one i am baker helped catapult into cakey internet fame ! i 've been really into mixing buttercream colours together lately and i thought a two-tone rosette would be a pretty twist on this cake. it 's really quite easy to achieve the rosette once you get the hang of using the piping bag , and if you muck up , you can remove the rosette and smooth the area with your offset spatula and pipe right on top of it ! no problemo ! okay ! ready to make a beautiful swirly girly two tone rosette covered buttercream cake ? 1. a baked and cooled layer cake of your choice - i made a three layer 7 inch round vanilla cake , tinted lightly with pink food colour. my awesome cake pal rosie has plenty of amazing recipes here , or you can make it from a box , too ! 2. four cups of vanilla buttercream. this one will do very well. 3. gel food colouring in pink and purple. 4. a piping bag fitted with a small open star tip. i used wilton brand tip # 22. 5. an offset spatula to frost your cake with a crumb coat. not sure how to frost a cake ? check out tessa 's awesome tutorial here . make your buttercream according to your recipe 's instructions. divide into two bowls and tint one bowl with the purple and one bowl with the pink. i used just a dab of gel colour ( it 's potent ! ) to achieve these colours . next , frost and fill your layer cake until you get to the crumb coat stage . fit your piping bag with your piping tip using a coupler and a ring . like so ! now , fill one vertical half of the piping bag with the purple buttercream. i use a yogurt container to help with this step - simply open piping bag and pull the sides over the container to help with filling with buttercream . fill the second vertical half with pink buttercream. yes... i know it 's not even steven here ! that 's ok ! now , squeeze out the bag so the colours run together. then , pipe away some designs to get a feel for using it. i just practice-pipe on a plain plate or piece of parchment paper . time to move to your cake ! start at the bottom of the cake and work your way up. to create this rosette , you want to start piping the rosette in the middle and pipe outward counter-clockwise. i piped three rotations to get this particular look. the key is to keep the buttercream flowing - do n't stop piping until the entire rosette is done . keep on keepin ' on ! pipe the whole exterior of the cake , then pipe the top too ! i love to finish my cakes with a single fresh berry. i also made this ridiculously cute cake flag using my prized " hello " stamp from the talented bambs over at think & ink studio . what 's that you say ? cut you a larger piece , please ? and i 'll have a side of raspberries with mine ! anyone have any fun memories of birthday cakes as children ? i have fond memories of my mom breaking out the bunny cake pan and coming up with a white shredded coconut covered bunny with black licorice whiskers and jujube eyes ! hope you enjoyed this buttercreamy fun tutorial - see you again soon ! meet the contributor lyn ­ d ­ say sung is a baker and blog ­ ger at coco cake land . she loves super cute cakes , sweet design and snacks. she lives in van ­ cou ­ ver , canada with her hus ­ band and tod ­ dler son . at 1 : 17 am 3 comments : 0 thursday is pink ! we 're nearing week 's end and these colour weeks always seem to fly by do n't they ?
