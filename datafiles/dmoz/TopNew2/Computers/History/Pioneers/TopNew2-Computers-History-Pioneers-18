[ 1 ] he received the 1972 turing award for fundamental contributions to developing programming languages , and was the schlumberger centennial chair of computer sciences at the university of texas at austin from 1984 until 2000 . shortly before his death in 2002 , he received the acm podc influential paper award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. this annual award was renamed the dijkstra prize the following year , in his honor . contents 1 life and work 2 ewds and writing by hand 3 awards and honors 4 see also 5 references 6 external links life and work [ edit ] dijkstra was born in rotterdam . his father was a chemist who was president of the dutch chemical society ; he taught chemistry at a secondary school and was later its superintendent. his mother was a mathematician , but never had a formal job. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] dijkstra studied theoretical physics at leiden university , but quickly realized he was more interested in computer science. originally employed by the mathematisch centrum in amsterdam , he held a professorship at the eindhoven university of technology , worked as a research fellow for burroughs corporation in the early 1980s , and later held the schlumberger centennial chair in computer sciences at the university of texas at austin , in the united states. he retired in 2000 . among his contributions to computer science are a shortest path algorithm , known as dijkstra 's algorithm ; the shunting yard algorithm ; the the multiprogramming system , an important early example of structuring a system as a set of layers ; the banker 's algorithm ; and the semaphore construct for coordinating multiple processors and programs. another concept due to dijkstra in the field of distributed computing is that of self-stabilization – an alternative way to ensure the reliability of the system. dijkstra 's algorithm is used in spf , shortest path first , which is used in the routing protocols ospf and is-is . while he had programmed extensively in machine code in the 1950s , he came to the conclusion that in high-level languages frequent use of the goto statement was usually symptomatic of poor structure. in 1968 he wrote a private paper " a case against the go to statement " , [ 4 ] which was then published as a letter in cacm. [ 5 ] editor niklaus wirth gave this letter the heading " go to statement considered harmful " , which introduced the phrase " considered harmful " into computing. dijkstra 's thesis was that departures from linear control flow were clearer if allowed only in disciplined higher-level structures such as the if-then-else statement and the while loop . this methodology was developed into structured programming , the title of his 1972 book , coauthored with c.a.r. hoare and ole-johan dahl . dijkstra also strongly opposed the teaching of basic . [ 6 ] dijkstra was known to be a fan of algol 60 , and worked on the team that implemented the first compiler for that language. dijkstra and jaap zonneveld , who collaborated on the compiler , agreed not to shave until the project was completed. since then dijkstra always had a beard. [ 7 ] it was one of the first compilers supporting recursion . [ 8 ] dijkstra wrote two important papers in 1968 , devoted to the structure of a multiprogramming operating system called the , and to cooperating sequential processes. [ 9 ] from the 1970s , dijkstra 's chief interest was formal verification . the prevailing opinion at the time was that one should first write a program and then provide a mathematical proof of correctness . dijkstra objected , noting that the resulting proofs are long and cumbersome and give no insight on how the program was developed. an alternative method is program derivation , to " develop proof and program hand in hand " . one starts with a mathematical specification of what a program is supposed to do and applies mathematical transformations to the specification until it is turned into a program that can be executed. the resulting program is then known to be correct by construction . much of dijkstra 's later work concerns ways to streamline mathematical argument. in a 2001 interview , [ 10 ] he stated a desire for " elegance " , whereby the correct approach would be to process thoughts mentally , rather than attempt to render them until they are complete. the analogy he made was to contrast the compositional approaches of mozart and beethoven . dijkstra was one of the early pioneers in the field of distributed computing. in particular , his paper " self-stabilizing systems in spite of distributed control " started the sub-field of self-stabilization . many of his opinions on computer science and programming have become widespread. for example , he coined the programming phrase " two or more , use a for " , [ citation needed ] alluding to the rule of thumb that when you find yourself processing more than one instance of a data structure , it is time to consider encapsulating that logic inside a loop. he was the first to make the claim that programming is so inherently complex that , in order to manage it successfully , programmers need to harness every trick and abstraction possible. when expressing the abstract nature of computer science , he wrote the job [ of operating or using a computer ] was actually beyond the electronic technology of the day , and , as a result , the question of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition became in the early days the all-overriding concern. as a result , the topic became — primarily in the usa — prematurely known as " computer science " — which , actually is like referring to surgery as " knife science " — and it was firmly implanted in people 's minds that computing science is about machines and their peripheral equipment. quod non [ latin : " which is not true " ] . [ 11 ] he died in nuenen on 6 august 2002 after a long struggle with cancer. [ 12 ] the following year , the acm ( association for computing machinery ) podc influential paper award in distributed computing was renamed the dijkstra prize in his honor . ewds and writing by hand [ edit ] dijkstra was known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his fountain pen . the manuscripts are called ewds , since dijkstra numbered them with ewd , his initials , as a prefix. according to dijkstra himself , the ewds started when he moved from the mathematical centre in amsterdam to the eindhoven university of technology ( then technische hogeschool eindhoven ) . after going to eindhoven , dijkstra experienced a writer 's block for more than a year. looking closely at himself he realized that if he wrote about things they would appreciate at the mc in amsterdam his colleagues in eindhoven would not understand ; if he wrote about things they would like in eindhoven , his former colleagues in amsterdam would look down on him. he then decided to write only for himself , and in this way the ewds were born. dijkstra would distribute photocopies of a new ewd among his colleagues. many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies , so the ewds spread throughout the international computer science community. the topics were computer science and mathematics , and included trip reports , letters , and speeches. more than 1300 ewds have been scanned , with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search , and are available online at the dijkstra archive of the university of texas. [ 13 ] one of dijkstra 's sidelines was serving as chairman of the board of the fictional mathematics inc. , a company that he imagined having commercialized the production of mathematical theorems in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs. he invented a number of activities and challenges of mathematics inc. and documented them in several papers in the ewd series. the imaginary company had produced a proof of the riemann hypothesis but then had great difficulties collecting royalties from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the riemann hypothesis. the proof itself was a trade secret . [ 14 ] many of the company 's proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company 's effort had to be spent on maintenance . [ 15 ] a more successful effort was the standard proof for pythagoras ' theorem , that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs. [ 16 ] dijkstra described mathematics inc. as " the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived " . [ 14 ] ewd 443 ( 1974 ) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world 's market share. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] dijkstra at the blackboard during a conference at eth zurich in 1994 despite having invented much of the technology of software , dijkstra eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. almost all ewds appearing after 1972 were hand-written. when lecturing , he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. even after he acquired an apple macintosh computer , he used it only for email and for browsing the world wide web.
