[ 1 ] bell received a b.s. ( 1956 ) , and m.s. ( 1957 ) in electrical engineering from mit . he then went to the new south wales university of technology in australia on a fulbright scholarship , where he taught classes on computer design , programmed one of the first computers to arrive in australia ( called utecom , an english electric deuce ) and published his first academic paper. returning to the u.s. , he worked in the mit speech computation laboratory under professor ken stevens , where he wrote the first analysis by synthesis program . career [ edit ] digital equipment corporation [ edit ] the dec founders ken olsen and harlan anderson recruited him for their new company in 1960 , where he designed the i/o subsystem of the pdp-1 , including the first uart . bell was the architect of the pdp-4 , and pdp-6 . other architectural contributions were to the pdp-5 and pdp-11 unibus and general registers architecture. [ 2 ] after dec , bell went to carnegie mellon university in 1966 to teach computer science , but returned to dec in 1972 as vice-president of engineering , where he was in charge of the vax , dec 's most successful computer . entrepreneur and policy advisor [ edit ] bell retired from dec in 1983 as the result of a heart attack , but soon after founded encore computer , one of the first shared memory , multiple-microprocessor computers to use the snooping cache structure . during the 1980s he became involved with public policy , becoming the first and founding assistant director of the cise directorate of the nsf , and led the cross-agency group that specified the nren . bell also established the acm gordon bell prize ( administered by the acm and ieee ) in 1987 to encourage development in parallel processing . the first gordon bell prize was won by researchers at the parallel processing division of sandia national laboratory for work done on the 1000-processor ncube 10 hypercube . he was a founding member of ardent computer in 1986 , becoming vp of r&d 1988 , and remained until it merged with stellar in 1989 , to become stardent computer . microsoft research [ edit ] between 1991 and 1995 , bell advised microsoft in its efforts to start a research group , then joined it full-time in august 1995 , where he still works ( as of 2010 ) , studying telepresence and related ideas. he is the experiment subject for the mylifebits project , an experiment in life-logging ( not the same as life-blogging ) and an attempt to fulfill vannevar bush 's vision of an automated store of the documents , pictures ( including those taken automatically ) , and sounds an individual has experienced in his lifetime , to be accessed with speed and ease. for this , bell has digitized all documents he has read or produced , cds , emails , and so on. he continues to do so , gathering web pages browsed , phone and instant messaging conversations and the like more or less automatically. the dutton book , total recall , describes the vision and implications for lifelogging — the process of creating and maintaining a personal , lifetime e-memory for recall , work , health , education , and immortality.

" microsoft nt...is going to be very far-reaching. it 's going to grab the rug out from under unix . " " in 10 years , you 'll see 99 % of the hardware and software systems sold through what are fundamentally retail stores. " " twenty-five years from now...computers will be exactly like telephones. they are probably going to be communicating all the time ... i would hope that by the year 2000 there is this big [ networking ] infrastructure , giving us arbitrary bandwidth on a pay-as-you-go basis. " " somebody once said , 'he 's never wrong about the future , but he does tend to be wrong about how long it takes. ' " some of his classic sayings while working at dec : " the most reliable components are the ones you leave out. " at the february 10 , 1982 , ethernet announcement at the world trade center with bob noyce of intel and david liddle of xerox , he stated : " a broadband cable for tv is like a sewer pipe that in principle can carry gas , water , and waste : it is easy to get all that shit in there , but hard to separate it out again. " " ethernet is the uart of the 1980s. " " ... the network becomes the system.
