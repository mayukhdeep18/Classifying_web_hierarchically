/node /buildmode /.panel-inner /.panel-sidebar-left tools for thought the history and future of mind-expanding technology by howard rheingold /.panel-inner /.panel-one-col overview the digital revolution did not begin with the teenage millionaires of silicon valley , claims howard rheingold , but with such early intellectual giants as charles babbage , george boole , and john von neumann. in a highly engaging style , rheingold tells the story of what he calls the patriarchs , pioneers , and infonauts of the computer , focusing in particular on such pioneers as j. c. r. licklider , doug engelbart , bob taylor , and alan kay. taking the reader step by step from nineteenth-century mathematics to contemporary computing , he introduces a fascinating collection of eccentrics , mavericks , geniuses , and visionaries . the book was originally published in 1985 , and rheingold 's attempt to envision computing in the 1990s turns out to have been remarkably prescient. this edition contains an afterword , in which rheingold interviews some of the pioneers discussed in the book. as an exercise in what he calls " retrospective futurism , " rheingold also looks back at how he looked forward . /.panel-inner /.panel-one-col about the author howard rheingold , an influential writer and thinker on social media , is the author of tools for thought : the history and future of mind-expanding
