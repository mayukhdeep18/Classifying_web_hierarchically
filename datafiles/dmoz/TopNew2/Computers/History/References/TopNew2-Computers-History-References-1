home library welcome to my little home library.. at the beginning , i created this database for my private use - to assist finding whatever i was looking for. however , i have since moved the database to a public server hoping that it will be useful to someone. at least search engines seem to like to crawl it. by no means the content of this database is ment to be complete - there is only stuff that i have access to ; nothing more , nothing less. further , it is very likely that there is incorrect content - i 'm sure that i have at least mixed up some of the authors. when you happen to spot an error , then please let me know . some statistics : the database contains 372 books , 565 issues of 55 magazines and 65 software titles . there is references to 2250 authors as well as 12445 article entries . the oldest publication in the database is atk - automaattinen tietojenk Ã¤ sittely from 1967 while the newest is an issue of the nt insider released at 2007 . you can browse the library contents by author book title magazine software title publisher or you can have a look at the front covers of books , magazines or software titles . this page has been created by sami rautiainen . read the small print . last updated aug 19 , 2008
