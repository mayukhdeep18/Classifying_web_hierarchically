( the abacus was one of the first counting machines. calculating machines were sold commercially before the advent of steel manufacturing technologies. papyrus was something to write on , before we had paper. writing was a way to record mathematical calculations. ) this history of computers site includes the names of early pioneers of math and computing and links to related sites for further study. a new " timeline of the history of computers and related technologies " has been added. this site was designed to be used by students assigned topics about the history of computers and computing. original articles are footnoted and related links are included . one important purpose of this web page , is to debunk myths some people create , such as " we have computers because of the military " ( not true ) . we have computers because man wanted to quantify as early as the ancient chinese dynasties , when they created the abacus and used it for calculating , and adding and subtracting in particular... babbage and lovelace were " programming " machines as early as the 1800 's before any military computer in this country. 1801 was the creation of the jacquard loom which used " punch cards " . cathode ray tubes ( crts ) have been around since 1885 and the us gov't first used a computer in the 1950 's. great britain 's colossus was developed before the engigma , so people trying to perpetuate the importance of the us military in the development of computer technologies is doing a disservice to students. electronics and related computer development , and the invention of the transistor were all independent of military intent. if anything , even the totalisator machines were created for statistical purposes and have been used for horse racing , not rocket science. i love my mac , and it has no military background that i am aware of . military computers did not have integrated circuits like pc computer chips either... stop saying computer development was military in origin... simply ca n't back it up with fact. yes , the military also had old computers , just like my commodore was old... but they were n't related... no tubes in my commodore , that was different technology altogether than a military monster computer with vacuum tubes... mechanical relays... ta dah... that was hot stuff in that age . begins the text ads bar -------------- end google text links -------------- main table cell google search bar search google close search bar * * * * * * * * computer history : specific topics * * * * * * * * * [ a ] [ b ] [ c ] [ d ] [ e ] [ f ] [ g ] [ h ] [ i ] [ j ] [ k ] [ l ] [ m ] [ n ] [ o ] [ p ] [ q ] [ r ] [ s ] [ t ] [ u ] [ v ] [ w ] [ x ] [ y ] [ z ] - a - = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = abacus = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = abacus the abacus ( hitmill.com : good pictures , overview , brief history , definition , counting boards , bibliography , and links for further study ) a brief history of the abacus = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ada = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ada , the programming language . ada was a us governmental ( dod ) developed programming language. the standard was originally known as ada83 , but this is now obsolete , as it was recently " overhauled " and re-born as ada95. this is now the preferred standard and implementation of the ada programming language. read more about it : ada programming at u. of mich . ada programming resources ( hitmill.com ) introduction to ada95 ( embedded.com ) mission critical programming concepts with ada95 : introduction to the ada programming language training class ( ddci.com ) = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = aiken = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = aiken , howard hathaway howard hathaway aiken and the mark i howard hathaway aiken and the mark i howard aiken : makin ' a computer wonder howard hathaway aiken , computer pioneer howard aiken 's harvard mark i = = = = = = altair computers , mits , ed roberts = = = = altair computer altair 8800 ( wikipedia ) introduction the revolution begins ( david bunnell ) the altair 8800 and ed roberts altair history ( onlineethics.org ) early history of the personal computer ( by thayer watkins at san jose state university ) brief history of the altair ( highgate.comm.sfu.ca ) the virtual altair museum " ed roberts interview ( virualaltair.com ) what good is a computer without software ?

( see arpa links ) later , a branch off of arpa became nasa and they used computers but projects were space oriented.. arpanet was the non-military branch that created the internet nodes , first being at the non-military ucla. the army could have computers because of pre-exisiting technologies that had no prior connection with the military. stop giving the military the credit for having computers... the military had a need and had computers built to fill a need , but none of the technologies up until then had to do with the military 's think tank... the inventors were independent of the us military , or had been civililians when asked to help the military to build the computers. a brief history of computers and networks ( goldenink.com ) = = = = = = = = computer conservation society = = = = = computer conservation society computer conservation society * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * d * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * = = = = = = = = = difference engine = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -
