" carpenter said , " the grid will open up ... storage and transaction power in the same way that the web opened up content. " and just as the internet connects various public and private networks , cisco systems ' bob aiken said , " you 're going to have multiple grids , multiple sets of middleware that people are going to choose from to satisfy their applications. " as conference moderator walter hoogland suggested , " the world wide web gave us a taste , but the grid gives a vision of an ict ( information and communication technology ) -enabled world. " though the task of standardizing everything from system templates to the definitions of various resources is a mammoth one , the ggf can look to the early days of the web for guidance. the grid that organizers are building is a new kind of internet , only this time with the creators having a better knowledge of where the bottlenecks and teething problems will be. the general consensus at the event was that although technical issues abound , the thorniest issues will involve social and political dimensions , for example how to facilitate sharing between strangers where there is no history of trust. amsterdam seemed a logical choice for the first global grid forum because not only is it the world 's most densely cabled city , it was also home to the internet engineering task force 's first international gathering in 1993. the ietf has served as a model for many of the ggf 's activities : protocols , policy issues , and exchanging experiences. the grid forum , a u.s.-based organization combined with egrid - the european grid forum , and asian counterparts to create the global grid forum ( ggf ) in november , 2000. the global grid forum organizers said grid communities in the united states and europe will now run in synch. the grid evolved from the early desire to connect supercomputers into " metacomputers " that could be remotely controlled. the word " grid " was borrowed from the electricity grid , to imply that any compatible device could be plugged in anywhere on the grid and be guaranteed a certain level of resources , regardless of where those resources might come from. scientific communities at the conference discussed what the compatibility standards should be , and how extensive the protocols need to be. as the number of connected devices runs from the thousands into the millions , the policy issues become exponentially more complex. so far , only draft consensus has been reached on most topics , but participants say these are the early days. as with the web , the initial impetus for a grid came from the scientific community , specifically high-energy physics , which needed extra resources to manage and analyze the huge amounts of data being collected. the most nettlesome issues for industry are security and accounting. but unlike the web , which had security measures tacked on as an afterthought , the grid is being designed from the ground up as a secure system. pagebreak conference participants debated what types of services ( known in distributed computing circles as resource units ) provided through the grid will be charged for. and how will the administrative authority be centralized ? corporations have been slow to cotton to this new technology 's potential , but the suits are in evidence at this year 's grid event. as ggf chairman charlie catlett noted , " this is the first time i 've seen this many ties at a grid forum. " in addition to ibm , firms such as boeing , philips and unilever are already taking baby steps toward the grid. though commercial needs tend to be more transaction-focused than those of scientific pursuits , most of the technical requirements are common. furthermore , both science and industry participants say they require a level of reliability that 's not offered by current peer-to-peer initiatives : downloading from napster , for example , can take seconds or minutes , or might not work at all. garnering commercial interest is critical to the grid 's future. cisco 's aiken explained that " if grids are really going to take off and become the major impetus for the next level of evolution in the internet , we have to have something that allows ( them ) to easily transfer to industry. " other potential grid components include creating a virtual observatory , and doctors performing simulations of blood flows. while some of these applications have existed for years , the grid will make them routine rather than exceptional. the california institute of technology 's paul messina said that by sharing computing resources , " you get more science from the same investment. " ian foster of the university of chicago said that web precursor arpanet was initially intended to be a distributed computing network that would share cpu-intensive tasks but instead wound up giving birth to e-mail and ftp. the grid may give birth to a global file-swapping network or a members-only citadel for moneyed institutions. but just as no one ten years ago would have conceived of napster -- not to mention amihotornot.com -- the future of the grid is unknown. an associated datagrid conference continues until friday , focusing on a project in which resources from pan-european research institutions will analyze data generated by a new particle collider being built at swiss particle-physics lab cern . end article content close toolbox_art_bot see also : there 's no biz like e-biz you know it/is important there 's no biz like e-biz you know it/is important projects with power to burn genome effort hits home projects with power to burn genome effort hits home search wired top stories magazine wired blogs all wired related topics : tech biz , science , media , it , discoveries close article_footer close article_body reuters start xrail : article subscribe to wired renew give a gift customer service services subscription : subscribe | give a gift | renew | international | questions | change address quick links : contact us | login/register logout | newsletter | rss feeds | tech jobs | wired mobile | faq | sitemap sitemap | faq | contact us | wired staff | advertising | press center | subscription services | newsletter | rss feeds cond é nast web sites : webmonkey | reddit | arstechnica | details | golf digest | gq | new yorker subscribe to a magazine : view all titles allure architectural digest bon app é tit brides cond é nast traveler details glamour golf digest golf world gq lucky self teen vogue the new yorker vanity fair vogue w wired cond é nast web sites : allure architectural digest arstechnica bon app é tit brides.com cond é nast traveler cond é nast portfolio concierge details epicurious glamour golf digest golf world gq hotel chatter jaunted lucky nutrition data reddit self style.com teen vogue the new yorker vanity fair vogue webmonkey w international sites : wired uk wired italy wired japan wired.com © 2014 cond é nast. all rights reserved. use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement ( effective 3/21/12 ) and privacy policy ( effective 3/21/12 ) . your california privacy rights . the material on this site may not be reproduced , distributed , transmitted , cached or otherwise used , except with the prior written permission of cond é nast . ad choices close content div close shell div stats sitecatalyst code version : h.15.1. copyright 1997-2008 omniture , inc . /do not remove/ end sitecatalyst code version : h.15.1 . scripts lazy load images when possible
