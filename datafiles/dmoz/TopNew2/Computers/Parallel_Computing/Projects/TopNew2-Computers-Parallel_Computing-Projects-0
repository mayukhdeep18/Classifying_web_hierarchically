current projects : multicore operating systems , resin , uia , system security past projects people publications software search mit csail we build and investigate software systems for parallel and distributed environments. we have conducted research in operating systems , networking , mobile computing , language design , compiler design , and architecture , taking a pragmatic approach : we build high-performance , reliable , and working systems . our most recent research focuses on multicore processors , linux scalability , and systems security . our publications provide more details about our projects . < p > in general , our research focuses on extensible and flexible system services : filesystems , networking , and languages . < a href = " /chord/ " > chord < /a > is a distributed hash table for use in very large scale distributed systems . the < a href = " http : //iris.csail.mit.edu " > iris < /a > project is a large , ongoing collaboration. see the < a href = " http : //iris.csail.mit.edu " > iris page < /a > for more details . < a href = " /click/ " > click < /a > is a flexible , modular router that runs on commodity hardware. < a href = " http : //www.fs.net/ " > sfs < /a > , the self-certifying file system , creates a global , secure filesystem with a single global namespace and no centralized control. < a href = " /tickc/ " > ` c < /a > ( tick-c ) is a superset of the ansi c language with extensions for dynamic code generation. new algorithms in the ` c compiler result in fast and high-quality runtime compilation. the < a href = " /prolac/ " > prolac < /a > language aims to make network protocol implementations both readable and efficient. < /p > < p > the < a href = " /exo/ " > exokernel < /a > , a novel operating system architecture , was the framework of much of our prior research. an exokernel eliminates the high-level abstractions most of today 's operating systems are built on , instead concentrating on securely and efficiently multiplexing the raw hardware. a more conventional operating system interface is provided by application-level libraries. this allows untrusted applications to safely override default os functionality for extensibility , flexibility , or performance. < /p > support thanks to the national science foundation , darpa , quanta computer , google , intel , at&t , and ibm for supporting our research .
