the monash parallel parametric modelling engine ( ppme ) is a cluster of computers designed specifically for large parametric modelling computations . because it supports the concurrent execution of one program on multiple machines , it can achieve performance many times faster than would be possible on a single computer . the current system specifications are : 2 x 330 mhz pentium ii processors 2 x 350 mhz pentium ii processors 8 x 500 mhz pentium iii processors 26 x 700 mhz pentium iii processors 26 x 800 mhz pentium iii processors 52 x 3 ghz pentium 4 processors 60 gbytes ram ~ 2.5 tbytes disk space the cluster is comprised of 72 machines at the clayton campus made up of 2 servers and 70 nodes ( client machines ) . 52 of these ( 50 nodes and 2 servers ) are intel 3ghz p4 with 1gb ram while the remainder are dual-processor pentiums ( 700 or 800mhz piii ) . most machines are running linux although there are a couple running windows. a gigabit network connects all machines together with network access via the high speed grangenet . experiments are controlled using the axceleon enfuzion program . this software suite allows a user to specify an experiment using a simple gui based tool , and then to perform the work on the nodes of the cluster . this machine has been funded by the school of computer science and software engineering , the school of business systems and the monash university research fund . copyright Â© 1998-2004 monash university
