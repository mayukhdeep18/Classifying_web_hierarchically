welcome to the world wide web home page for the d system , a research project of the parallel programming systems group at rice university . objective we are conducting research into program analysis , code generation , and programming tools for data-parallel languages like high performance fortran . if this research is successful , computational scientists and engineers will be able to write machine-independent , data-parallel programs for a broad spectrum of scientific applications , and achieve high performance with these programs on a variety of parallel architectures . to find out more.. . overview of the d system project the dhpf compiler technical papers software , documentation & reported bugs the d team related research projects elsewhere career opportunities please direct questions about the d system to dsystem-info @ cs.rice.edu . other pages on the project and the group 's other research : the dhpf compiler home page fy1996 arpa blue book pages fortran tools home page fortran tools glossary updated july 1997 . http : //www.cs.rice.edu/ ~ dsystem/
