fourth international workshop on formal methods for parallel programming : theory and applications fmppta'99 : modeling and proving in conjunction with second merged symposium ipps/spdp 1999 13th international parallel processing symposium & 10th symposium on parallel and distributed processing april 12 - april 16 , 1999 caribe hilton , san juan , puerto rico sponsored by ieee computer society technical committee on parallel processing in cooperation with : acm sigarch , ieee computer society technical committee on computer architecture ( tcca ) , and ieee computer society technical committee on distributed processing ( tcdp ) , formal methods have been widely investigated in academic institutions and more recently have been applied in industry. they allow systems and their properties to be described precisely using mathematical notation. algorithmic solutions are developed from the formal specification with the help of mathematical techniques and tools. although they may be expensive to apply , formal methods are the only way to ensure that an implementation is correct with respect to a specification , and are thus an important tool for the development of reliable systems . the objective of the workshop is to gather people , both from academia and industry , who use and/or develop formal methods for parallel programming. fmppta'99 will emphasize two steps related to formal methods : the modeling phase where the problem is stated formally , and the proving phase that demonstrates the correctness of an implementation. as this workshop is a part of ipps/spdp , authors are strongly invited to use real case studies borrowed from parallel processing or distributed computing. topics call for papers ( deadline is over ) programme &nbsp program committee contacts publications submissions requests to dominique.mery @ loria.fr
