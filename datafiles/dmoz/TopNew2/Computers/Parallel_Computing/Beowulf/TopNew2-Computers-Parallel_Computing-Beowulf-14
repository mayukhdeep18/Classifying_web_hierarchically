what is jazznet ? jazznet is a dedicated cluster of personal computers ( pcs ) used for applied mathematics and scientific computations at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) . this resource is used as a personal supercomputer to carry out computational tasks too large for conventional workstations. the pc cluster is dubbed jazznet because its nodes are named after great jazz artists : miles davis , ella fitzgerald , and so on . built using off-the-shelf components ( intel pentium-ii motherboards , linux , fast ethernet ) , it can achieve multi-gflop performance for around $ 15k . but more importantly , on real applications it competes surprisingly well with systems costing 10-100 times more . because the system is inexpensive ( about the cost of a high-end workstation ) , it can be used as a personal supercomputer , rather than a resource that must be shared by many people . we use jazznet both to distribute sequential jobs for increased throughput , and also as a parallel processing environment , using pvm and mpi . overview performance applications hardware software related sites credits roldan pozo photos : bob parent photo archive development status : historical : no longer maintained . privacy policy last modified : 03/31/2004
