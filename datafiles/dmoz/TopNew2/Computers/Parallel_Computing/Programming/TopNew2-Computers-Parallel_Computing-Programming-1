friday , march 14 , 2014vin aachen , germany this event will continue the tradition of previous annual week-long events that take place in aachen every spring since 2001 . throughout the week we will cover a wide spectrum of topics , ranging from serial programming ( monday ) to parallel programming using mpi ( tuesday ) and openmp ( wednesday ) in both fortran and c/c + + as well as performance tuning. furthermore , we will introduce the participants to modern features of the openmp standard like vectorisation and programming for accelerators and for the many integrated core ( mic ) architecture ( thursday ) as well as gpgpu programming with openacc ( friday ) . hands-on exercises for each topic will be provided , which should not discourage you from working on your own code . the topics are presented in a modular way , so that you could pick specific ones and register for the particular days only in order to let you invest your time as efficiently as possible . attendees should be comfortable either with c/c + + or fortran programming and interested in learning more about the technical details of application tuning and parallelization. the presentations will be given in english . there is no seminar fee. all other costs ( e.g. travel , hotel , and consumption ) are at your own expenses . allocation is on a first come , first served basis , since the seminar room is of limited capacity. please register separately for each session you would like to attend . http : //www.rz.rwth-aachen.de/ppces the registration deadline is march 3 , 2014 . the event is kindly sponsored by the bull company . posted on march 3 , 2014 to < a href = " http : //openmp.org/wp/category/uncategorized/ " title = " view all posts in website " rel = " category tag " > website < /a > by rchrd » openmp arb issues new mission statement in recent years , openmp has shifted from being solely focused on shared- memory systems to also include accelerators , embedded systems , multicore and real-time systems. today the openmp architecture review board ( arb ) releases a new mission statement to formalize this change . a technical report on directives for attached accelerators was first released in 2012 , and subsequently , a full revision of the standard , openmp 4.0 , was released in 2013 , which included support for accelerators , simd constructs to vectorize both serial as well as parallelized loops , error handling , thread affinity , and tasking extensions . following these releases , the openmp arb is ready for a new mission statement. the old mission statement was focused on shared-memory systems , but the new mission statement broadens this mandate to “ standardize directive-based multi-language high-level parallelism that is performant , productive and portable. ” “ the new mission statement for openmp is the result of a collaborative consultation between members , industry , and academia ” , said michael wong , openmp ceo. “ it recognizes the changing landscape of parallelism by broadening our mandate to cover more types of architecture , be more robust , responsive , and dynamic while remaining firmly committed to our pedigree. with our firm footing now supporting accelerators and embedded systems , we are open to begin further exploration into more affinity , deeper task dependencies , full error-model , numa-access , fpga , transactional memory , asynchronous and even-driven programming , inter-nodal and intra-nodal interoperability. ” posted on february 27 , 2014 to < a href = " http : //openmp.org/wp/category/uncategorized/ " title = " view all posts in website " rel = " category tag " > website < /a > by rchrd » dieter an mey appointed to openmp board of directors february 13 , 2014 -
