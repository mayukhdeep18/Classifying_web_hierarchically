the tons project current release : 0.0.8 ( january 28th ) welcome to the home of the tons project. tons stands for tons of numerical services. the goal of the tons project is to create a state-of-the-art tool for scientists and engineers who wish to perform numerical investigations . the tons system has a three-tier architecture as shown below. a number of clients are connected to the scheduler. each client request a calculation performed and recieve it when it has terminated. the scheduler sends the request to a number of nodes. a calculation might be parallellized by the scheduler . we invision that the clients can be of very different nature. one could be a simple command-line calculator like bc , another could a simulation program for the solar system with a graphical user interface. only the client-programmers ' imagination is the limitation ! a quickstart guide to tons is available here . the fully implemented tons system will consist of many components. they are : the tons server which schedules the requests from the clients by forwarding the requests to the nodes . the node server that should be running on one or more machines ( if tons is running in a cluster ) . the programming language tal . tal is short for tons algoirthmic language . a library of functions called stall which stands for standard tal library . the tons server is a virtual machine which runs tbc ( tons bytecode ) . the tbc can be created by tasm ( tons assembler ) . the simple tons client abbriviated stc is the tons team 's showcase of a client . you can download the latest version of the tons system here . the tons team consists of the following people : jakob ř stergaard ( scheduler and vm ) . kenneth geisshirt ( tal compiler ) . the tons project is hosted by sk ĺ ne sj ć lland linux user group . this page was last modified by jakob ø stergaard january 28 , 2000
