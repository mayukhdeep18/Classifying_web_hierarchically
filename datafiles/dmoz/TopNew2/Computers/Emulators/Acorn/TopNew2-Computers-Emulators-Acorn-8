( printing only works in risc os 3 at the moment ) . revision history date version changes 02/09/07 f stores separate configuration in arc.cfg for each risc os type 02/09/07 e fixed a problem with 1772 emulation discs now read in risc os 2 02/09/07 d recognise adl format disc images added risc os 2 and 3 application/support discs to installation file 01/09/07 c disabled full borders option when in full screen mode ( as turning full borders off causes crash which i ca n't track down ) 01/09/07 b got the real time clock working added new application disc images to hard disc image added desktop ! boot file to automatically load postscript printer driver renamed printer output file to printer.ps to make viewing/printing in osx easier 31/08/07 a fixed graphic corruption running on power pc in full screen mode may have problem with full screen palette though.. . 31/08/07 xx.xx stopped crash when changing memory size through menu program now reads arc.cfg on startup rather than using defaults changed middle menu button to command-left click added full screen option reduced window size when turn off full borders 19/08/07 xx.xx added the acorn application discs 1 and 2 to the hard disc image 18/08/07 xx.xx put f14 back in as additional menu key to alt-command key 18/08/07 xx.xx converted to statically linked libraries tested down to mac os 10.3.9 18/08/07 xx.xx added printer support 18/08/07 xx.xx the mouse pointer now stays in the main window the mouse menu button has moved from f14 to alt-command the gui menu has moved from ctrl-f14 to ctrl-alt-command ( these three keys can also be used to release the mouse ) caps-lock has moved from f13 back to the caps-lock key removed the sound crackle on startup mutes sound when gui menu is displayed 13/08/07 xx.xx initial release risc os 3.11 booting lemmings title screen lemmings level 1 screen ( with sound ! ) msnavigation msnavigation msnavigation [ home ] [ up ] send mail to jon @ g7jjf.com with questions or comments about this web site . copyright Â© 2006 jon welch last modified : 17-08-2010 msnavigation
