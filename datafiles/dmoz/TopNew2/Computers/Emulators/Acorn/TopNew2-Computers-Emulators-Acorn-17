( this may change in the future. i do n't consider model-b dead - i just do n't have the time to work on it ! ) special thanks to dave moore of the very-much-worth-a-visit the stairway to hell for organising this webspace . instanceendeditable tom seddon -- email modelb snail bbcmicro full-stop com instanceend
