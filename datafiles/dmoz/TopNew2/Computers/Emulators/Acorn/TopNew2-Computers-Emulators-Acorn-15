retro computing : bbc micro goldmine introdution this page is dedicated to the bbc microcomputer , a home computer dating from the early 1980 's , on which the foundations of my computer-knowledge were built. also to all those who wrote the extremely helpful books and magazines at that time , particularly to the contributers of " micro user " magazine. what you may not know is that there are some great bbc emulators around , which let you run all your favorite bbc programs and games from the comfort of your ibm pc. i strongly recommend pcbbc ( or at the ? newer ? , but less pretty site at pcbbc ) , written by stuart mcconnachie of nottingham. see also the bbc lives website for lots of links to beeb-related stuff. backup and file transfer odds are that if you 've got a bbc computer , you have a pile of 5.25 " floppy disks which are taking up space , and gradually decomposing. probably the best way of preserving that data for the future is to copy the disks to your pc while you can ( assuming you still have an operational bbc micro to hand ) . the pcbbc emulator -- and most of the others apparently -- require a " disk image " file : this is just one big pc file which contains literally all the data from a bbc floppy disk. this kind of file preserves all the load , run , and execute addresses of files ( which many applications require ) , and can faithfully reproduce the extra information used by many special disk formats used by games for anti-piracy measures. although i have included details of a minimal file-transfer system below , there are probably better ones elsewhere on the net. bbc-disk-image-on-pc to native pc filesystem transfer my main contribution to the bbc-on-pc field at present is a windows 95/98/nt based " bbc disk-image content extractor " - a program to extract individual files from those ubiquitous bbc-disk-images to your pc filesystem. the program works with both dfs and adfs disk images. when i get time , i should enable it to de-tokenise basic programs , and display bbc screen dumps and amx art pictures. in the mean time , if you need listings of bbc basic programs as pc text files , you should run an emulator such as pcbbc , load the file you want to list , type * spool txtfile , list , * spool -this will write a text listing to the bbc disk-image , which you can then extract using my program. downloads download the bbc disk-content extractor : bbcdisk.exe ( 268kb ) [ win95/98/nt only ] . as always , by downloading software from my website , you consent to my disclaimer ( see elsewhere on my site ) - basically that all programs are supplied in good faith , but that you accept the full risk : i am liable for nothing in the event that anything goes amiss . bbc-to-pc disk transfer if you 've got this far , you are probably familiar with the bbc microcomputer ! as i mentioned before , there are probably better systems elsewhere on the net. however , if you have the programmer mentality ( as most beeb affictionados do ) , the material here should be enough to get you started. what you need access to a working bbc computer and disk drive a short program on your trusty beeb to send the data a serial cable to connect your bbc to your pc a short program on your pc to receive the data to a file a bbc emulator and/or a program to read individual files off your disk images and into the regular pc filesystem bbc " send " programs type the program ( s ) into your bbc micro , and save to its disk ( if you have any left ) . for standard bbc b dfs-format disks 10 rem program to transfer images ( of dfs ) bbc computer disks to a pc 20 rem via the serial port , for archival storage. 30 rem ( c ) w.a.steer 1998 40 rem 50 * key0 oscli " fx8,8 " : oscli " fx7,8 " : oscli " fx3,1 " : oscli " fx181,0 " : oscli " fx2,1 " | m 60 addr = &70 70 check = &74 80 dim d % 10240 90 procassem 100 mode7 110 * fx21,0 120 procinitdiscs 130 proclm 140 proccopy 150 goto100 160 end 170 : 180 defprocinitdiscs 190 input' ' " dfs source drive : " so % 200 : 210 print' ' " please put source disc into drive " ; so % 220 print " and press any key " ; : a = get : print 230 a % = &7e : x % = &70 : y % = &09 : call&fff1 240 ? &973 = 0 250 tr % = ! &970 div 2560 260 endproc 270 : 280 defproclm 290 print' ' " ensure drive is set to " ; 300 if tr % = 40 then print " 40 " ; else print " 80 " ; 310 print " tracks.

[ eg c : \ bbcdisks \ disk1.img ] please only use 8-letter directory and filenames - the program was written for 16-bit windows ! note that the pcbbc emulator expects adfs disk images to have the extension " .adf " and dfs ones " .img " . when the file has transferred , a checksum figure is displayed on both machines. it is up to you to see that these tally. if they do n't , your only option is to re-send the disk until it does. failing all that , the full version ( ł 10 ) of pcbbc incorporates some file-transfer programs -- which i have n't tried myself. rs232/423 cable details to follow. you ought to put resistive droppers in the cable on the signal lines driven by your pc. this prevents possible damage to your trusty beeb , and may be required in order for the transfer to work anyway ! last modified : 5 december 1999 source : http : //www.ucl.ac.uk/ ~ ucapwas/bbc/ © william andrew steer email : w.steer @ ucl.ac.uk
