need to add allen tucker 's mac stuff mic1 is a java-based simulator which implements the mic-1 microarchitecture described in chapter 4 of andrew s. tanenbaum , structured computer organization , fourth edition ( prentice-hall , 1998 ) . the software available here is designed to support instructors and students using this text. additional supplemental material for this and other tanenbaum texts is available from the author 's site . mic1 was written by ray ontko and dan stone with advice from andrew s. tanenbaum and support from prentice-hall . send comments , suggestions , enhancements to ray ontko ( rayo @ ontko.com ) . distribution 1.0e production release ( monday , 24-apr-2000 08 : 36 : 04 est ) for unix-based systems : compressed tar archive 173k for win95/98/nt systems : self-extracting zip archive 289k other releases ( historical and developmental ) are also available for downloading . the mic1 software is written in java and requires the java runtime environment ( jre ) 1.0 ( or later ) or the java development kit ( jdk ) 1.0 ( or later ) to run . java technology is available from sun or one of its technology partners. visit http : //www.java.sun.com/ ( and follow the " products " link ) to find a suitable distribution . note : you may be able to get mic1 to work on other operating systems or with other java runtime environments. problems have been reported with symantec java under win2k , but our investigations were not conclusive. if you are able to get it running in that environment , let me know ( rayo @ ontko.com ) . the mic1 microassembler utilizes the cup parser generator for java , written by scott hudson . all other programs and modules are written directly in java and are intended to be compatible with jdk 1.0 and later . the mic1 software is distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license . the source code is included in the distribution . note : the following documentation and sample files are included in the distribution but are also available here for browsing. you do not need to download the documentation separately . documentation ( included in distribution ) mic1 user guide release notes frequently asked questions ( faq ) ijvm assembly language specification micro-assembly language ( mal ) specification mic1sim manual page mic1asm manual page ijvmasm manual page sample files ( included in distribution ) echo.jas , a simple ijvm program demonstrating input and output . add.jas , a more complex ijvm program demonstrating method calls . ijvmtest.jas , a program to test the ijvm instructions . mic1ijvm.mal , a microprogram for the mic1 architecture which implements a simplified java virutual machine called ijvm . ijvm.conf , a configuration file for the ijvm assembler. this file maps op codes to mnemonics and instruction formats . the mic1 software includes : a simple mic-1 simulator ( mic1sim ) which allows the user to simulate the execution of a mic-1 microprogram , a simple mic-1 assembler ( mic1asm ) which translates a text-file containing mic-1 microassembly language ( mal ) into a binary file of mic-1 microinstructions , suitable for loading into the mic1 simulator control store , a sample mic-1 microprogram which interprets a modified ( integer-only ) subset of sun 's java virtual machine ( jvm ) instruction set architecture ( isa ) ( which we shall call ijvm ) , a simple ijvm assembler ( ijvmasm ) which translates a text-file containing ijvm into a binary file of ijvm instructions , suitable for loading into the main memory of the mic1 simulator , and a sample ijvm program which can be used to demonstrate the operation of the mic-1 microprogram using the mic1 simulator . some possible projects ( in increasing order of complexity ) : write a program in ijvm. demonstrate that your program works correctly using the ijvm assembler and the mic-1 simulator . add a new feature to the ijvm assembler . add a new instruction to ijvm and implement it as an extension to the mic-1 ijvm microprogram. modify the ijvm assembler to correctly identify and generate code for your new instruction . demonstrate that your new mic-1 microprogram correctly interprets an appropriate test program containing your new instruction . write a microprogram in mic-1 microassembly language . add a new feature to the mic-1 microassembler . add a new register to the mic-1 architecture . implement a simulator for the mic-2 architecture . implement a simulator for the mic-3 architecture . implement a simulator for the mic-4 architecture . while several of these projects support the material covered in chapter 4 , the microarchitecture level , there are several that are applicable to other parts of the text. for example , there are a number which develop concepts introduced in chapter 7 , the assembly language level . you need to have more documentation explaining how things work , what the various file types do , man pages for the programs , and a worked example where the user is shown step by step how to take an example ijvm program and assemble and run it and see what the results are . other mic1
