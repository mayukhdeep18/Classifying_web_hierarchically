tim 's hercules page background i am probably one of the more unusual hercules and mvs users because i used hercules before i ever used a real mainframe. one day in january 2005 while i was feeling curious i searched for " os/360 emulator " on google and stumbled across the hercules community. i was much more comfortable using linux so for the first few months i spent most of my time playing with linux on s/390 and zseries while occasionally trying to figure out mvs. i realize how confusing mvs can be to people who have no previous experience. i 'm aiming to write the documentation on this site for all hercules and mvs users , but with enough detail so first time mainframe users can follow along. that said , due to my own relative inexperience , there may be some errors or incorrect explanations here or there , but i have personally used all the steps i document on the site on my own system and can confirm that they work for me. i encourage feedback on anything confusing or anything that i may not have explained correctly or completely. i would like to thank all the folks on the hercules mailing lists who have helped me with mvs and answered my various questions. i would also like to thank the people who make hercules and the mvs turnkey system , as well as vm/370 , dos/360 , and music/sp possible and continue to enhance them. mvs turnkey v3 guides installing hercules , installing the latest version of hercules for windows 2000/xp and linux installing rpf , a free alternative to ispf installing and using ind $ file , a pc-to-mainframe file transfer utility installing gccmvs , a free c compiler using gccmvs , a brief tutorial practical gccmvs , some more practical uses of gccmvs installing rakf , a security system inspired by racf installing hercmd , a program that lets you execute hercules ( and host operating system ) commands from tso pdf printing from jes2 , a homebrew tool for automatically generating nicely formatted pdfs on the fly external mvs guides how can i import files from outside hercules/mvs 3.8 ?
