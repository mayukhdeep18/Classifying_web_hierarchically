" for the first time in over 20 years i can finally do whatever i want with the operating system. in my effort to be a part and contribute to the mvs 3.8 efforts i have attempted to create some basic documentation that should be of help to others . if you have any questions , comments , suggestions , or corrections , please send me a note at tommy @ tommysprinkle.com thanks , tommy
