desktop cyber emulator desktop cyber ( dtcyber ) emulates a range of control data corporation cyber mainframes and peripherals in software. dtcyber is a high-performance software emulation running on a modern windows or linux host. the emulator provides past users of cyber mainframes with an accurate emulation of all aspects of the legacy hardware. all cdc operating systems and application software run unmodified on modern hardware. performance of the emulation on an average desktop pc is better than on legacy hardware . dtcyber emulates the following mainframe types : cdc 6400 cdc cyber 73 cdc cyber 173 cdc cyber 175 cdc cyber 170 model 865 dtcyber emulates the following subsystems : cpu central memory of up to 256k words ( 6400 , cyber 73 , cyber 173 and cyber 175 ) central memory of up to 1024k words ( cyber 170 model 865 ) extended core storage ( ecs ) or unified extended memory ( uem ) 10 or 20 peripheral processors ( pps ) 12 or 24 channels to external devices real-time clock display controller interlock registers ( cyber 73 ) cmu ( cyber 73 and cyber 173 ) status and control registers ( cyber 173 and cyber 175 ) maintenance registers ( cyber 170 model 865 ) dtcyber emulates the following peripherals and associated controllers : cc545 console 669 tape drives 679 tape drives 844 disk drives 885 disk drives 405 card reader 415 card punch 501 printer 512 printer 6676 terminal multiplexer 2550 npu running ccp with async tip two-port multiplexer ( cyber 170 model 865 ) the emulation has been verified on the following cdc operating systems or maintenance/diagnostic systems : smm 4.0 cmm 1.2a kronos 2.1 nos 1.2 nos 1.3 nos 1.4 nos 2.1 nos 2.3 nos 2.4.2 nos 2.5.3 nos 2.8.1 nos 2.8.2 nos 2.8.7 nos/be 1.5 scope/hustler dtcyber does not run nos/ve which requires virtual mode available only on cyber 180s . note : no cdc operating system is included with dtcyber. users must supply their own os installation tapes to make use of the emulator. please contact tom hunter for help with conversion of existing 9-track tapes to tap disk images used by the emulator . screenshots of dtcyber links to general info about cdc cyber related material photos and cdc advertising material desktop cyber sources ( licensed under gpl 3.0 ) number of visitors :
