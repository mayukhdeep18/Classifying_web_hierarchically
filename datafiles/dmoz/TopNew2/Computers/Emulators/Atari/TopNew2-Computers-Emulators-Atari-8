virtualdub.org proof that i had too much free time in college current version altirra 2.50 navigation main page altirra , an 8-bit atari computer emulator i had access to a number of 8-bit computers in my childhood , but my most favorite was the atari 800 , a 1.79mhz 6502-based computer with color graphics and a disk drive , and which as the predecessor to the amiga , another favorite of mine. over a decade later , i was struck by both nostalgia and ambition and started to write a new 8-bit atari emulator from scratch. this is the result. at this point , i 've learned a lot more about the atari and altirra now emulates more than i ever had or did years ago , but i still work on it periodically. it also serves as a modularity test for the virtualdub code base , from which altirra shares some components. if you are struck by nostalgia too or have a desire to do some atari development , perhaps it might be useful to you , too. note : neither the author nor the software on this page is affiliated with atari , and there is no code or software from atari included in the downloads. all trademarks belong to their respective owners. system requirements altirra has relatively few system requirements : windows 2000 , xp , vista , 7 , 8 or later ( either 32-bit or x64 edition ) . pentium cpu or better ( 1ghz or faster recommended ) . if you can run virtualdub , you can run altirra , with the one exception that it will not work with the win9x derived versions of windows ( windows 95/98/me ) . before you begin altirra is designed with emulation quality in mind , sometimes over speed and polish. it 's designed as a system emulator and debugger instead of a games machine , so there is some setup involved. there is a readme file in the archive , but here are some quick tips : first : software. you need some actual 8-bit atari ( not atari st ! ) software to run. if you do n't have any , it 'll be a pretty boring experience. i ca n't give this to you for various reasons , but there are freely available demos , and if you have converted your atari software to disk images for other emulators , those will work too. specifically , disk images are supported in atr , dcm , atx , and pro formats ; some simple cartridge types are also supported , and you can directly load atari executables as well ( .obx/.xex ) . second : kernel roms. altirra has an internal kernel that can be used to run atari software , and thus you can run demos , games , and productivity software without needing any atari rom images. however , this kernel is reimplemented from scratch , and has some compatibility problems. therefore , you may want to consider hooking up real kernel rom images , which will greatly increase altirra 's software compatibility. i 'm afraid i ca n't offer these for download , but if you have downloaded rom images from your atari , altirra uses the same format and filenames as most other popular atari 8-bit system emulators. third : compatibility. altirra is designed to emulate the actual atari hardware as closely as possible. its compatibility has been increasing over time , and at this point it should run most software correctly. however , there can still be problems , some of which may be emulation bugs , and some of which are related to hardware emulation settings. tips : disable basic ( unless you 're actually running a basic program ) . for older games , use 800 hardware and 48k ram , and the os-b kernel. for newer games , use xl hardware and 128k ram ( xe ) , and use the xl kernel. for demos and games written in europe , use xl hardware/kernel , 320k ram , and pal. if you do n't have kernel rom images , use the hle kernel instead. downloads altirra is licensed under the gnu general public license ( gpl ) . binaries ( i.e. stuff you can run ) : altirra 2.50 binary ( local download ) altirra 2.40 binary ( local download ) altirra 2.30 binary ( local download ) altirra 2.20 binary ( local download ) altirra 2.10 binary ( local download ) altirra 2.00 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.9 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.8 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.7 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.6 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.5 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.4 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.3 binary ( local download ) altirra 1.2 binary ( local download ) source code ( i.e. stuff programmers can modify and compile ) : altirra 2.50 source code ( local download ) altirra 2.40 source code ( local download ) altirra 2.30 source code ( local download ) altirra 2.20 source code ( local download ) altirra 2.10 source code ( local download ) altirra 2.00 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.9 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.8 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.7 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.6 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.5 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.4 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.3 source code ( local download ) altirra 1.2 source code ( local download ) the compile requirements are the same as for virtualdub 1.9.2 : visual studio 2005 , yasm 0.4.0 + , directx sdk , platform sdk ( now windows sdk ) . acid800 test suite acid800 is a test suite designed to stress 8-bit atari emulators. it tests a wide variety of program-visible hardware behaviors and reports any deviations from actual hardware behavior , such as missing features or incorrect timing. acid800 can be run either as a full suite or as standalone tests , with symbols and source included. also included are the acid5200 test suite for the 5200 supersystem and the acidsap suite for sap players. acid800 1.1 binaries and source ( local download ) acid800 1.0 binaries and source ( local download ) 16k ram support. new tests : pia interrupts , antic playfield start/stop timing , pokey serial port. fixes to cpu instruction and mmu banking tests. acid800 0.9 binaries and source ( local download ) added virtual dma and vscrol + dli tests. acid800 0.8 binaries and source ( local download ) hardware reference manual this is a document describing all of the interesting behavior i 've discovered in the atari 8-bit hardware. altirra hardware reference manual , 5/14/2013 version ( local download , pdf ) screenshots a complex screen in the game alley cat. running the spartados x shell. mid-scanline changes in the bewesoft 8 players demo. 3d graphics in the numen demo. running drac030 's 65c816 xl/xe os. debugging one of the gtia unit tests. running basic in enhanced text mode. changelog version 2.50 : [ features added ] basic : altirra basic is now the default when no basic rom is included. cartridge : added support for another 512k/4mb/8mb flash cartridge. cartridge : added support for the !
