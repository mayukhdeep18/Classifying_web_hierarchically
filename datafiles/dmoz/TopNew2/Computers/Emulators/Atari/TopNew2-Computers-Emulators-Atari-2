a8e is a freeware atari 800 xl emulator written in c by sascha springer and has been developed completely from scratch. it uses the sdl library for the user interface and the audio and graphics ( via opengl ) output . a8e features nothing special compared to the other excellent atari 8 bit emulators floating around and in case of having some trouble with a8e you should stick with the others for a better experience . in fact , the a8e project is just a personal effort to provide a solution to preserve the atari 8 bit programs and a challenge for myself to get this emulator working , nothing more. the primary goal was to develop an emulator based on freely available informations and documents about the atari 800 xl . so at last i decided to share the result with the atari community and here it is ! have fun... sascha
