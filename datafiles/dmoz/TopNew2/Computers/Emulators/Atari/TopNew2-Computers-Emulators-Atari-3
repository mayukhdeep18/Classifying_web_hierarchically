home atari800macx sio2osx downloads links contact x atari800macx now supports synchronized sound , a graphical debugger , vapi and pro images , copy and paste from the emulator , configuration files , and a new hard disk emulation scheme . there have been other enhancments and bug fixes as well , see below . atari800macx has required many hours of work in development , and is now donationware . if you enjoy it , please donate through this link . this is the home page of the macintosh os x port of david firth 's fantastic atari 800 emulator. i have ported the sdl version of the atrari800 emulator to mac os x , and added a full native cocoa interface , including preferences , menus , file associations , help and more. it does not require libsdl to be installed separately , but includes it within the application package. it does however require rom image files from the original atari systems , which are not included here. special thanks go to jacek poplawski for writing the general sdl port , and the entire libsdl team that has made this port possible. ( as well as to the whole atari800 team for their invaluable support and suggestions. please visit their website at http : //atari800.sourceforge.net for full info on their emulator core. ) many thanks to daniel noguerol for his hard work on the original and ported versions of the r : driver. also thanks to al yarusso at atariage for mirroring the binary and source , and macupdate for mirroring the binary . and of course dan and the rest of you who have sent in invaluable bug and testing reports . why did i write another atari emulator for the mac ? derek ledbetter has a good port of atari800 for os9 and carbon on os x. however , i really wanted an emulator that could keep up with all of the features of the atari800 emulator , including full cartridge and machine support , hard drives , etc. in addition , i wanted a full screen mode in addition to the windowed mode of derek 's port . also , derek 's port is dependent on code warrior â„¢ , and i wanted an emulator that could be built with apple 's great free tools provided with macos x. project builder does not build carbon executables for use on os 9 , so therefore there is n't an os9 version . news : 12-29-2011 version
