page heading -- common to all pages an h8 for the rest of us ! this reads " site " on the index page and " page " on all others site last updated home release support design resources legal site map 8-may-2003 standard content ends. page body starts here. new / updated material  download this site welcome ! i built my first h8 system — a hardware unit like the one to the right — sometime in late 1979. it eventually had 56k of ram , three double-sided disk drives , an h-19 terminal and a xerox diablo daisy-wheel printer. the system lasted some ten or eleven years before the h8 " blew smoke " and died. i built my second h8 , this one a software emulation , the subject of this web site , starting in early 2001. i expect a bit more than eleven years of life from this h8 ! when i started this project i had a set of goals : preserve the look , feel , and operation of the front panel ; run the hdos 1.6 and 2.0 operating systems , unmodified ( including , though i did n't remember it at the time , hug 's replacement h-17 disk driver ) ; provide an emulated h-19 terminal , h-17 disk system , serial ports and other standard hardware ; run most user-written hdos programs ; allow access to the macintosh modem and printer. the overall goal was that , with few limitations , a program running inside the h8 emulator would not know the difference between the emulator and a real h8 / h-17 / h-19 environment. these goals have been met and , in many ways , surpassed. for example , i did n't expect to be able to run the disk diagnostic program , test17 , but in fact it runs great and gives good ( though pointless ) results. my other , personal , goal was to teach myself macintosh programming. i 'd written code for the apple iigs and was very familiar with the concepts. but there are many differences ; in fact , the mac toolbox interface is , in many ways , much more basic and crude than that in gs/os. regardless , the h8 emulator is not your typical macintosh program , and i think that i 've squeezed about all the macintosh programming knowledge i 'm going to squeeze out of this particular project. the project is , for all intents and purposes , complete with release 5.3.2 of the emulator. any remaining bugs will be fixed as they are found , but the feature set is complete. more than complete , if you consider the user convenience features added in the 5.2 release series. if i go any further along these lines , it will no longer be an h8 ! if there is any more h8 software i should be carrying in the hdos utilities subpage , please let me know what it is and where i might get it. i 've reorganized the site a bit and have room for more software. and if i can swing it , i 'd like to get the hdos source code and distribute it through this site. watch this space. anyway , please have a look around the site — i 'd recommend especially the design and help sections. and why not download the emulator and give it a try ! as you will see on the release and legal pages , the emulator is being distributed as freeware. thanks for visiting , and enjoy ! dave shaw heath8080a project go to top visitors since 4-march-2002 counter provided by footer area -- common to all pages home release support design resources legal site map copyright notice is only on the index page © 2001 , 2002 , 2003 by david a. shaw. please see the legal page for details. 10 big myths about copyright explained
