how the bochs works under the hood ( 2nd edition ) help wanted we currently need help with the following tasks : bug reports : mouse , interrupt controller , timer , ide controller , network card , keyboard , vga... most of our bug reports and feature requests are due to incomplete c + + models of the various pc devices. to improve this , we need pc hardware gurus who know where to find the specs for this stuff and improve the hardware models for bochs. working on models is a fun way to learn how things work , and unlike designing a real hard disk , you can test out your changes on a real operating system immediately ! disk images : our collection of disk images is getting out of date. it would be great to have small or large images of a variety of free operating systems . documentation : adding installation help and other useful information into the docs . to help with one of these tasks , please contact volker ruppert or stanislav shwartsman . older news june 1 , 2014 : bochs 2.6.5 is now available . may 26 , 2013 : bochs 2.6.2 is now available . april 7 , 2013 : bochs 2.6.1 is now available . september 2 , 2012 : bochs 2.6 is now available . january 6 , 2012 : bochs 2.5.1 is now available . november 27 , 2011 : bochs 2.5 is now available . february 23 , 2011 : bochs project moved to subversion source control. bochs 2.4.6 is the last release available from cvs ! february 22 , 2011 : bochs 2.4.6 is now available . april , 2010 : after long time bochs is back to top 25 of sourceforce projects ! april 25 , 2010 : bochs 2.4.5 is now available . november 12 , 2009 : bochs 2.4.2 is now available . june 7 , 2009 : bochs 2.4.1 is now available . may 3 , 2009 : bochs 2.4 is now available . june 3 , 2008 : bochs 2.3.7 is now available . december 24 , 2007 : bochs 2.3.6 is now available . september 16 , 2007 : bochs 2.3.5 is now available . august 27 , 2006 : bochs 2.3 is now available . january 29 , 2006 : bochs 2.2.6 is now available . december 30 , 2005 : bochs 2.2.5 is now available . july 8 , 2005 : bochs 2.2.1 is now available . may 28 , 2005 : bochs 2.2 is now available . august 1 , 2004 : bochs is sf project of the month for august 2004 ! more news.. . please send comments and questions concerning the site to volker ruppert . web site feature requests and bug reports should be added to the web site tracker . last modified on sunday , 15-jun-2014 07 : 34 : 53 utc trb .
