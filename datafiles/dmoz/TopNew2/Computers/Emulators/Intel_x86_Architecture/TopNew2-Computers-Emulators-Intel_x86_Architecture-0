software-only 8086 pc emulator for x here you can find the original version of david hedley 's 8086 pc emulator , and my " improved " version. this will emulate a basic pc with a vga text-only display quite well ; there is a reasonable amount of software that will work with no problems. the emulator uses the mfs.c code from linux dosemu to mount unix directories as drives under dos , so you can transfer data from the host to the target easily. the improved version supports ems memory and quite good floppy drive support . new i 've just ( at last ) got around to announcing the program 's existence to freshmeat. hi , everyone. however , i have n't updated anything beyond assigning a version number to it. it 's still a snapshot of an ancient development directory . pcemu-1.2.tar.gz version 1.2 updated to include ncurses based terminal support. added basic i186 support to allow freedos to boot. cleaned the source to compile with glibc 2.2.1 . pcemu-1.1.dg.tar.gz ( 339407 bytes ) version 1.1.dg this is the version that i ( dg ) produced from david hedley 's original code. this adds better floppy drive support , ems support , an x menu , better security , and it nearly runs on a dec alpha. it is not guaranteed to run out of the box , though , as this is pulled from a year-old working directory of mine . pcemu-1.0.tar.gz ( 118409 bytes ) version 1.0 this is david hedley 's original version . david given michael hope $ id : index.html,v 1.3 2002/03/17 16 : 27 : 01 dtrg exp $
