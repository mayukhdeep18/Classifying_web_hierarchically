free42 — an hp-42s calculator simulator what it is free42 is a re-implementation of the hp-42s calculator and the hp-82240 printer . it is a complete rewrite , not using any hp code , and it does not require an hp-42s rom image . free42 is an open source project. the executables and source code are released under the terms of the gnu general public license , version 2 . all third-party code used in free42 is either in the public domain , or licensed under terms compatible with gplv2 , or used with the authors ' permission . project status the latest release is 1.5.4 . if you 're interested in what 's been going on with free42 in the past , see the project history . for my thoughts about future improvements , check my to-do list . for questions or comments , visit the free42 forum at google groups . < table width = " 100 % " > < tr > < th bgcolor = " yellow " > notice < /th > < /tr > < tr > < td bgcolor = " # ffffc0 " > < center > this space for rent < /center > < /td > < /tr > < /table > < p > donations if you like free42 and use it regularly , or if you simply want to sponsor the free42 project , please make a donation . you can donate any amount you wish. all donations , large or small , will help keep free42 going . donations are processed by paypal . thank you for supporting the continued development of the free42 project ! downloads android ( arm ) get it at google play , or if you prefer the manual approach , download free42android.apk for side-loading . requires android 1.5 or later . ios get it from the itunes app store . requires ios 4.3 or later . windows download : free42windows.zip requires windows 2000 sp4 or later . if , when you try to run free42 , windows says " this application has failed to start because the application configuration was incorrect. reinstalling the application may fix this problem , " then you also need to download and install the microsoft visual c + + 2008 redistributable package . os x download : free42mac.zip requires os x 10.6 or later . linux download ( x86 ) : free42linux-32bit.tgz built in fedora 6 , with glibc 2.5 , libstdc + + 4.1.2 , and gtk + 2.10.13 . it should work on any linux ( x86 ) with those or similar libraries . download ( x86_64 ) : free42linux-64bit.tgz built in ubuntu 12.04 , with glibc 3.2 , libstdc + + 4.6.3 , and gtk + 3.4.2 . it should work on any linux ( x86_64 ) with those or similar libraries . additional downloads skins some skins to use instead of the faceplates built into free42. separate packages for : android , contains 11 skins , last updated august 2 , 2014 ; ios , contains 10 skins , last updated june 15 , 2013 ; windows , unix , and mac , contains 22 skins , last updated june 15 , 2013 . hp-42s/free42 programs a small collection of hp-42s/free42 programs . hp42s code editor a program for editing hp-42s programs on a pc . offers many helpful features . tested on windows xp and 7 . txt2raw.pl a perl script that converts hp-42s program listings , such as those generated by the prp and list commands , to free42/emu42 compatible " raw " program files . written by vini matangrano ; look here for documentation and the script itself . rom2raw a c program that converts hp-41 rom images to free42/emu42 compatible " raw " program files . download rom2raw.zip ; source code and win32 console executable included . note : the source code for this program is also included with the free42 source package . free42 source code download : free42.tgz download for gtk only , no hp logo , for building linux packages : upstream . • building the android version requires the android sdk 1.5 and ndk r4b or later . • for the ios version , i always use the latest xcode and ios sdks . you may be able to build it with earlier releases , too , but i can offer no guarantees on that . • for the windows version , you need microsoft visual c + + 2008 or later . • for the mac version , you need the os x sdk 10.6 or later . • the gtk version requires linux , or any reasonably unix-like environment , with x11 , gtk + , and the usual development tools and libraries . old and no longer supported versions pocket pc and windows mobile download : free42pocketpc.zip ( 1.4.71 ) requires pocket pc 2002 or 2003 ( arm ) or later , or windows mobile for pocket pc 5 or 6 . this version does not run under windows phone 7 or later . ( but this one does . ) additional skins palmos download : free42palmos.zip ( 1.4.71 ) requires palmos 3.0 or later . this package contains 68k and arm versions of the palmos application , and a hotsync conduit that allows you to transfer files between windows and the free42 filesystem on your palmos device . the binary 68k version requires the mathlib floating-point library ; in case you do n't already have it , you can get it here . the decimal 68k , binary arm , and decimal arm versions do not require mathlib . additional skins os x 10.5 download : free42mac.zip ( 1.4.74 ) requires os x 10.5 or later , intel or powerpc . os x dashboard download : free42macdashboard.zip ( 1.4.70 ) requires os x 10.4 or later , intel or powerpc . linux ( x86 ) with motif download : free42linuxmotif.tgz ( 1.4.71 ) built in fedora 6 with glibc 2.5 , libstdc + + 4.1.2 , and lesstif 0.95.0 . it should work on any linux ( x86 ) with those or similar libraries . source code for the old and no longer supported versions download : free42old.tgz • for building the pocket pc version , you need microsoft embedded visual c + + 3.0 . • for the palmos version , you need prc-tools ( with ton van overbeek 's multi-segment debugging patches applied ) . • for the palmos/windows conduit , you need microsoft visual c + + 6.0 . • building free42 for os x 10.5 for powerpc requires the os x sdk 10.5 ( not 10.4 or earlier because the code wo n't build ; not 10.6 or later because those versions wo n't generate powerpc code ) . • for the mac os x dashboard version , you need the os x sdk 10.4 or later . • the motif version requires linux , or any reasonably unix-like environment , with x11 , motif/lesstif , and the usual development tools and libraries . loading and saving programs loading and saving programs is possible in all free42 versions except os x dashboard. the exact process is pretty straightforward in the desktop versions ( windows , os x , linux ) , but it is a bit more complicated on mobile devices . for instructions for all versions , see here . documentation there is no manual for free42 per se , but since it is an accurate simulation of the hp-42s , the original hp-42s manual should be adequate for most purposes. the functionality that is specific to free42 , e.g. printer emulation , skin switching , etc. , is fairly simple and should be self-explanatory -- except perhaps for program import/export , which is documented here , and the accelerometer , gps , compass , and time/date functions , which are documented here . you can obtain a copy of the original hp-42s manual , in english , german , or portuguese , in pdf format , on cd-rom or dvd-rom , at the museum of hp calculators . look for the cd/dvd offers here . if you 're looking for something to help you get started without spending any money , i recommend the alternative hp-42s/free42 manual , written by jos é lauro strapasson and russ jones ; you can get it here , in pdf and word formats. there is also an epub version of this manual , suitable for most e-book readers ; provided by koen de vleeschauwer . binary and decimal floating-point while free42 originally used binary math exclusively , all releases starting with 1.4 have come in two versions , binary and decimal. the two look and behave identically ; the only difference is the way they represent numbers internally . all the free42 versions on this site include both the binary and decimal versions , except for the ios and android versions , which are decimal only . free42 decimal uses the intel decimal floating-point math library ; it uses ieee 754-2008 quadruple precision decimal floating-point , which consumes 16 bytes per number , and gives 34 decimal digits of precision , with exponents ranging from -6143 to + 6144 . free42 binary uses the pc 's fpu ; it represents numbers as ieee 754 compatible double precision binary floating-point , which consumes 8 bytes per number , and gives an effective precision of nearly 16 decimal digits , with exponents ranging from -308 to + 308 . the binary version has the advantage of being much faster than the decimal version ; also , it uses less memory. however , numbers such as 0.1 ( one-tenth ) can not be represented exactly in binary , since they are repeating fractions then. this inexactness can cause some hp-42s programs to fail . if you understand the issues surrounding binary floating-point , and you do not rely on legacy software that may depend on the exactness of decimal fractions , you may use free42 binary and enjoy its speed advantage. if , on the other hand , you need full hp-42s compatibility , you should use free42 decimal . if you do not fully understand the above , it is best to play safe and use free42 decimal . contact for questions and feedback , you are encouraged to use the free42 forum at google groups . if you prefer , you can also contact me , thomas okken , via email at thomas_okken @ yahoo.com . other hp-42s emulators/simulators note : these links are for informational purposes only ; i provide no support for them , but i believe they may be of interest to rpn and hp-42s fans . emu42 , hardware-level hp-42s emulator for windows and pocket pc , by christoph gie ß elink hp-42x , hardware-level hp-42s emulator for the hp-48/49 series calculators , by hrastprogrammer free42 for nokia internet tablet , ported by tatu m ä nnist ö free42 for sharp zaurus and nokia 770 , ported by egan ford 42s , enhanced free42 port for ios , by byron foster 42s , free42 port for windows phone 7 , by steven ray
