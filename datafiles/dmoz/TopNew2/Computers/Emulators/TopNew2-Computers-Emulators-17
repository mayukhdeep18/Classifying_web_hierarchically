emu48 15 years anniversary page please . the hp48 emulator emu48 was originally created by s é bastien carlier and is published under the gpl . the latest version of emu48 can emulate a hp38g , hp39g

professional versions. emu48 need rom images to work. because of license reasons rom 's are n't included , but they can be downloaded on several other sites. if you use patches , you have to install a complete executable package before. i fixed several bugs and many other problems. but are still some emulation problems left. many thanks to jean-yves avenard for his help on hardware specific problems. i also want to thank cyrille de brebisson for his first implementation of the hp49g in the hp49 sdk . since emu48 v1.49 of the win32 version the saving location of the emulator settings
