analysis of algorithms home page these pages are out of date and kept for archival. the site has moved to http : //aofa.cs.purdue.edu/ . pages maintained by philippe flajolet , rocquencourt , and helmut prodinger , johannesburg [ research | problems | bulletin board | people | resources ] [ european base | north american mirror ] a nalysis of algorithms ( aofa ) is a field in computer science whose overall goal is an understanding of the complexity of algorithms. while an extremely large amount of research is devoted to worst-case evaluations , the focus in these pages is methods for average-case and probabilistic analysis. properties of random strings , permutations , trees , and graphs are thus essential ingredients in the analysis of algorithms . t he subject was founded by knuth ( who coined the term " analysis of algorithms " in the mid-sixties ) and is well illustrated by his monumental series , the art of computer programming the field entertains close ties with a number of areas like discrete mathematics , combinatorial analysis , probability theory , analytic number theory , asymptotic analysis , complexity theory , and sometimes statistical physics . l t hese pages are the initiative of a bunch of people who gathered at a meeting specifically devoted to aofa , in dagstuhl , germany , in july 1997 . this site is open to all ! it is our objective that the pages become a forum for everyone with research interests in average-case and probabilistic analysis of algorithms . images and icons on this page are clickable . research this is for research papers , announcements of technical reports , preprints , and new results relative to analysis of algorithms that are available on the web . the list is now moderated by micha hofri . problems a list of open ( ? ) problems with comments and perhaps solutions . do n't hesitate to contribute.. . we 're starting this column with problems presented by the dagstuhl gang in july 1997. they are relative to quickselect , adaptive searching , quicksort , etc . bulletin board a place where you can freely express yourself . messages are simply archived here automatically and nobody 's mailbox is encumbered . people here , you 'll find mail and home page addresses of the founders and friends of the analysis of algorithms pages. also how to join . ( do n't be shy ! ) resources some pages that we enjoy and that you might well enjoy , too ! what about finding whether your newly discovered sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 , etc , is truly original ? is the constant 1.20205690315959428 expressible in terms of classical quantities ? how do i compute directly the billionth bit of pi ? also , books and journals that are relevant . email and links philippe.flajolet @ inria.fr , helmut @ gauss.cam.wits.ac.za for links to these pages , please use http : //algo.inria.fr/aofa/index.html * * * * * * * * * * * begin banner image * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * endbanner image * * * * * * * * * selected as member of the britannica internet guide . illustrations. al khwarizmi ( from the history of mathematics server ) ; the monkey saddle that appears in the analysis of connectivity in random graphs ( source : algorithms project ) ; a picture of schloss dagstuhl ( courtesy of maurice van keulen )
