etc upper skyscaper searching algorithms are closely related to the concept of dictionaries. dictionaries are data structures that support search , insert , and delete operations. one of the most effective representations is a hash table. typically , a simple function is applied to the key to determine its place in the dictionary. another efficient search algorithms on sorted tables is binary search . -google box ----- top large rectangle -end of google box ----- if the dictionary is not sorted , then heuristic methods of dynamic reorganization of the dictionary are of great value. one of the simplest are cache-based methods : several recently used keys are stored a special data structure that permits fast search ( for example , located at the top and/or always sorted ) . keeping the last n recently found values at the top of the table ( or list ) dramatically improves performance as most real life searches are cluster : if there was a request for item x [ i ] there is high probability that the same request will happen again after less then n lookups for other items. in the simplest form the cache can be merged with the dictionary : move-to-front method a heuristic that moves the target of a search to the head of a list so it is found faster next time. transposition method search an array or list by checking items one at a time. if the value is found , swap it with its predecessor , so it is found faster next time . in the paper on self-organizing sequential search heuristics , communications of the acm , v.19 n.2 , p.63-67 , feb. 1976 , r.l. rivest presents an interesting generalization of both methods mentioned above. the method a i ( for i between 1 and n ) performs the following operation each time that a record r has been successfully retrieved : move r forward i positions in the list , or to the front of the list if it was in a position less than i . this idea is somewhat reminiscent shell sort , efficiency of which is based on large jumps performed by elements that are out of order in parcially sorted sets. see also j. h. hester , d. s. hirschberg , self-organizing linear search , acm computing surveys ( csur ) , v.17 n.3 , p.295-311 , sept. 1985 you can also keep small number of " front " elements sorted and use binary search to find the element if this sorted subarray and only then linear search for the rest of array . among classic searching algorithms are liner search , hash tables and binary search. they can be executed on large number of various data structures such as arrays , lists , linked lists , trees . the latter views the elements as vertices of a tree , and traverse that tree in some special order. they are often used in searching large tables on directory names in filesystems. binary search algorithms also can be viewed as implicit tree search algorithm. volume 3 of knuth the art of computer programming [ 1998 ] contains excellent discussions on hashing. brief description of those algorithms can be found in wikipedia and various electronic book , for example sorting and searching algorithms : a cookbook by thomas niemann . mit open courseware in electrical engineering and computer science has the following lecture video : lecture 9 : binary search , bubble and selection sorts by eric grimson and john guttag . there is large number of useful animations of classic search algorithms. see for example java applets centre search algorithms linear search binary search trees and graphs binary tree traversal binary search tree ( search ) binary search tree ( insert , delete ) 2-3 tree ( insert ) graph traversal string searching algorithms are an important subdivision of search algorithms . a good description of the problem area given by alison cawsey ( alison-ds98 ) : motivation as mentioned above , string searching algorithms are important in all sorts of applications that we meet everyday. in text editors , we might want to search through a very large document ( say , a million characters ) for the occurence of a given string ( maybe dozens of characters ) . in text retrieval tools , we might potentially want to search through thousands of such documents ( though normally these files would be indexed , making this unnecessary ) . other applications might require string matching algorithms as part of a more complex algorithm ( e.g. , the unix program ` ` diff' ' that works out the differences between two simiar text files ) . sometimes we might want to search in binary strings ( ie , sequences of 0s and 1s ) . for example the ` ` pbm' ' graphics format is based on sequences of 1s and 0s. we could express a task like ` ` find a wide white stripe in the image' ' as a string searching problem . in all these applications the naive algorithm ( that you might first think of ) is rather inefficient. there are algorithms that are only a little more complex which give a very substantial increase in efficiency. in this section we 'll first introduce the naive algorithm , then two increasingly sophisticated algorithms that give gains in efficiency. we 'll end up discussing how properties of your string searching problem might influence choice of algorithm and average case efficiency , and how you might avoid having to search at all ! a naive algorithm the simplest algorithm can be written in a few lines : procedure naivesearch ( s1 , s2 : string ) : integer ; { returns an index of s2 , corresponding to first match of s1 with s2 , or } { -1 if there is no match } var i , j : integer ; match : boolean ; begin i : = 1 ; match : = false ; while match = false and i < = length ( s1 ) do begin j : = 1 ; { try matching from start to end of s2 , quitting when no match } while getchar ( s1 , i ) = getchar ( s2 , j ) and ( j < = length ( s2 ) ) do begin j : = j + 1 ; { increment both pointers while it matches } i : = i + 1 end ; match : = j > length ( s2 ) ; { there 's a match if you got to the end of s2 } i : = i-j + 2 { move the pointer to the first string back to { just after where you left off } end ; if match then naivesearch : = i-1 { if it 's a match , return index of s1 } { corresponding to start of match else naivesearch : = -1 end ; we 'll illustrate the algorithms by considering a search of string 'abc ' ( s2 ) in document 'ababcab ' ( s1 ) . the following diagram should be fairly self-explanatory ( the Ã® ndicates where the matching characters are checked each round ) : 'ababcab ' i = 1,j = 1 'abc ' ^ matches : increment i and j 'ababcab ' i = 2.j = 2 'abc ' ^ matches : increment i and j 'ababcab ' i = 3,j = 3 'abc ' ^ match fails : exit inner loop , i = i-j + 2 'ababcab ' i = 2 , j = 1 'abc ' match fails , exit inner loop , i = i-j + 2 ^ 'ababcab ' i = 3 , j = 1 'abc ' matches : increment i and j ^ 'ababcab ' i = 4 , j = 2 'abc ' matches : increment i and j ^ 'ababcab ' i = 5 , j = 3 'abc ' matches : increment i and j ^ i = 6 , j = 4 , exit loop ( j > length ( s2 ) ) , i = 4 , match = true , naivesearch = 3 note that for this example 7 comparisons were required before the match was found. in general , if we have a string s1 or length n , s2 of length m then a maximum of approx ( m-1 ) * n matches may be required , though often the number required will be closer to n ( if few partial matches occur ) . to illustrate these extremes consider : s1 = 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' , s2 = 'aaaaa ' , and s1 = 'abcdefghi ' , s2 = 'fgh' . the knuth-morris-pratt algorithm [ note : in this discussion i assume that we the index 1 indicates the first character in the string. other texts may assume that 0 indicates the first character , in which case all the numbers in the examples will be one less ] . the knuth-morris-pratt ( kmp ) algorithm uses information about the characters in the string you 're looking for to determine how much to ` move along ' that string after a mismatch occurs. to illustrate this , consider one of the examples above : s1 = 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' , s2 = 'aaaaa'. using the naive algorithm you would start off something like this : 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ match fails , move s2 up one. . 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ etc etc but in fact if we look at s2 ( and the 'b ' in s1 that caused the bad match ) we can tell that there is no chance that a match starting at position 2 will work. the 'b ' will end up being matched against the 4th character in s2 , which is an 'a'. based on our knowledge of s2 , what we really want is the last iteration above replaced with : 'aaaabaaaabaaaaab ' 'aaaaa ' ^ we can implement this idea quite efficiently by associating with each element position in the searched for string the amount that you can safely move that string forward if you get a mismatch in that element position. for the above example. . a 1 if mismatch in first el , just move string on 1 place . a 2 if mismatch here , no point in trying just one place , as that 'll involve matching with the same el ( a ) so move 2 places a 3 a 4 a 5 in fact the kmp algorithm is a little more cunning than this. consider the following case : 'aaaab ' i = 3,j = 3 'aab ' ^ we can only move the second string up 1 , but we know that the first character will then match , as the first two elements are identical , so we want the next iteration to be : 'aaaab ' i = 3,j = 2 'aab ' ^ note that i has not changed. it turns out that we can make things work by never decrementing i ( ie , just moving forward along s1 ) , but , given a mismatch , just decrementing j by the appropriate amount , to capture the fact that we are moving s2 up a bit along s1 , so the position on s2 corresponding to i 's position is lower. we can have an array giving , for each position in s2 , the position in s2 that you should backup to in s2 given a mismatch ( while holding the position in s1 constant ) . we 'll call this array next [ j ] . j s2 [ j ] next [ j ] 1 a 0 2 b 1 3 a 1 4 b 2 5 b 3 6 a 1 7 a 2 in fact next [ 1 ] is treated as a special case. in fact , if the first match fails we want to keep j fixed and increment i. one way to do this is to let next [ 1 ] = 0 , and then have a special case that says if j = 0 then increment i and j . 'abababbaa ' i = 5 , j = 5 'ababbaa ' ^ mismatch , so j = next [ j ] = 3 'abababbaa ' i = 5 , j = 3 'ababbaa ' ^ ------------------- 'abaabbaa ' i = 4 , j = 4 'ababbaa ' ^ mismatch , so j = next [ j ] = 2 'abaababbaa ' i = 5 , j = 2 'ababbaa ' ^ ------------------- 'bababbaa ' i = 1 , j = 1 'ababbaa ' ^ mismatch , so j = next [ j ] = 0 , increment i and j . 'abaababbaa ' i = 2 , j = 1 'ababbaa ' ^ it 's easy enough to implement this algorithm once you have the next [ .. ] array . the bit that is mildly more tricky is how to calculate next [ .. ] given a string . we can do this by trying to match a string against itself. when looking for next [ j ] we 'd find the first index k such that s2 [ 1..k-1 ] = s2 [ j-k + 1..j-1 ] , e.g : 'ababbaa ' s2 [ 1..2 ] = s2 [ 3..4 ] 'aba.... ' so next [ 5 ] = 2 . ^ ( essentially we find next [ j ] by sliding forward the pattern along itself , until we find a match of the first k-1 characters with the k-1 characters before ( and not including ) position j ) . the detailed implementations of these algorithms are left as an exercise for the reader - it 's pretty easy , so long as you get the boundary cases right and avoid out-by-one errors . the kmp algorithm is extremely simple once we have the next table : i : = 1 ; j : = i ; while ( i < = length ( s1 ) and j < = length ( s2 ) ) do begin if ( j = 0 ) or ( getchar ( s1,i ) = getchar ( s2 , j ) ) ) then begin i : = i + 1 ; j : = j + 1 end else j : = next [ j ] end ; ( if j = length ( s2 ) when the loop exits we have a match and can return something appropriate , such as the index in s1 where the match starts ) . the boyer-moore algorithm although the above algorithm is quite cunning , it doesnt help that much unless the strings you are searching involve alot of repeated patterns. it 'll still require you to go all along the document ( s1 ) to be searched in. for most text editor type applications , the average case complexity is little better than the naive algorithm ( o ( n ) , where n is the length of s1 ) . ( the worst case for the kmp is n + m comparisons - much better than naive , so it 's useful in certain cases ) . the boyer-moore algorithm is significantly better , and works by searching the target string s2 from right to left , while moving it left to right along s1. the following example illustrates the general idea : 'the caterpillar ' match fails : 'pill ' there 's no space ( ' ' ) in the search string , so move it ^ right along 4 places 'the caterpillar ' match fails. there 's no e either , so move along 4 'pill ' ^ 'the caterpillar ' 'l ' matches , so continue trying to match right to left 'pill ' ^ 'the caterpillar ' match fails. but there 's an 'i ' in 'pill ' so move along 'pill ' to position where the 'i 's line up . ^ 'the caterpillar ' matches , as do all the rest. . 'pill ' ^ this still only requires knowledge of the second string , but we require an array containing an indication , for each possible character that may occur , where it occurs in the search string and hence how much to move along. so , index [ 'p ' ] = 1 , index [ 'i ' ] = 2 , index [ 'l ' ] = 4 ( index the rightmost 'l ' where repetitions ) but index [ 'r ' ] = 0 ( let the value be 0 for all characters not in the string ) . when a match fails at a position i in the document , at a character c we move along the search string to a position where the current character in the document is above the index [ c ] th character in the string ( which we know is a c ) , and start matching again at the right hand end of the string. ( this is only done when this actually results in the string being moved right - otherwise the string is just moved up one place , and the search started again from the right hand end. ) the boyer-moore algorithm in fact combines this method of skipping over characters with a method similar to the kmp algorithm ( useful to improve efficiency after you 've partially matched a string ) . however , we 'll just assume the simpler version that skips based on the position of a character in the search string . it should be reasonably clear that , if it is normally the case that a given letter doesnt appear at all in the search string , then this algorithm only requires approx n/m character comparisons ( n = length ( s1 ) , m = length ( s2 ) ) - a big improvement on the kmp algorithm , which still requires n. however , if this is not the case then we may need up to n + m comparisons again ( with the full version of the algorithm ) . fortunately , for many applications we get close to the n/m performance. if the search string is very large , then it is likely that a given character will appear in it , but we still get a good improvement compared with the other algorithms ( approx n * 2/alphabet_size if characters are randomly distributed in a string ) . top updates your browser does not support iframes . bulletin latest past week past month google search news contents sorting and searching algorithms by thomas niemann c minimal perfect hashing library 0.8 joseph culberson 's binary search tree research publications other references simulations of dynamic sequential search algorithms old news ;

[ 2 ] focused on this problem. this research indicates that in fact the depth grows as o ( n ^ { 1/2 } ) . a proof under certain simplifying assumptions was given in the theoretical analysis in algorithmica [ 3 ] , while a set of simulations was presented together with a less formal analysis of the more general case , in the computer journal [ 4 ] , intended for a wider audience. a complete analysis for the most general case is still open . more recently p. evans [ 5 ] has demonstrated that asymmetry may be even more dangerous in smaller doses ! algorithms with only occasional asymmetric moves tend to develop trees with larger skews , although the effects take much longer . publications joseph culberson. updating binary trees. msc thesis , university of waterloo department of computer science , 1984.

we have seen this already in the lab about cockatoos and gorillas. all of the storage retrieval operations are almost trivial : insertion is just a single cons of the element on the front of the list. search involves recurring down the list , each time checking whether the front of the list is the element we need. deletion is similar to search , but we cons the elements together as we travel down the list until we find the element , at which point we return the cdr of the list. we also did analysis on these algorithms and deduced that the runtime is o ( n ) . c + + examples - linear search in a range on the competitiveness of linear search c + + notes : algorithms : linear search csc 108h - lecture notes ... linear search ( sequential ) . start with the first name , and continue looking until x is found. then print corresponding phone number. ... linear search ( on a vector ) . .. . linear search : 1.1 description/definition the simplest of these searches is the linear search . a linear search is simply searching through a line of objects in order to find a particular item. .. . linear search linear search . no jdk 1.3 support , applet not shown.&nbsp ;

fibonacci search . this finds the maximum of a unimodal function on an interval , [ a , b ] , by evaluating points placed according to a fibonacci sequence , { f_n } . if there are f_n points in the interval , only n evaluations are needed . in the continuous case , we begin with some interval of uncertainty , [ a,b ] , and we reduce its length to ( b-a ) /f_n. the ratio , g_n = f_ ( n-1 ) /f_n , is the key to the placements . here is the method for the continuous case : initialization . let x = a + ( 1 - g_n ) ( b-a ) and y = a + g_n ( b-a ) . evaluate f ( x ) and f ( y ) and set n = n . iteration . if f ( x ) < f ( y ) , reduce the interval to ( x , b ] ( i.e. , set a = x ) , decrement n to n-1 , and set x = y and y = a + g_n ( b-a ) . if f ( x ) > = f ( y ) , reduce the interval to [ a , y ) ( i.e. , set b = y ) , decrement n to n-1 , and set y = x and x = a + ( 1-g_n ) ( b-a ) . the fibonacci search method minimizes the maximum number of evaluations needed to reduce the interval of uncertainty to within the prescribed length. for example , it will reduce the length of a unit interval [ 0,1 ] to 1/10946 ( = . 00009136 ) with only 20 evaluations. in the case of a finite set , fibonacci search finds the maximum value of a unimodal function on 10,946 points with only 20 evaluations , but this can be improved -- see lattice search . for very large n , the placement ratio ( g_n ) approaches the golden mean , and the method approaches the golden section search . here is a comparison of interval reduction lengths for fibonacci , golden section and dichotomous search methods. in each case n is the number of evaluations needed to reduce length of the interval of uncertainty to 1/f_n. for example , with 20 evaluations dichotomous search reduces the interval of uncertainty to . 0009765 of its original length ( with separation value near 0 ) . the most reduction comes from fibonacci search , which is more than an order of magnitude better , at . 0000914. golden section is close ( and gets closer as n gets larger ) . evaluations fibonacci dichotomous golden section n 1/f_n 1/2 ^ | _n/2_ | 1/ ( 1.618 ) ^ ( n-1 ) = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
