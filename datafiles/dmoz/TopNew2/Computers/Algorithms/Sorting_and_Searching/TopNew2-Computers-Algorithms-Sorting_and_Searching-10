- ) . the same is true if quicksort is over-emphasized in the course. but the most dangerous case is when the instructor emphasizes object oriented programming while describing sorting. that applies to book authors too . it 's better to get a second book in such case , as typically those guys try to obscure the subject making it more complex ( and less interesting ) than it should be. of course , as a student you have no choice and need to pass the exam , but be very wary of this trap. you might feel that you are failing the course just because the instructor is too preoccupied with oo machinery instead of algorithms. complexity of the algorithms is just one way to classify sorting algorithms . there are many others. one important classification is based on the internal structure of the algorithm : swap-based sorts begin conceptually with the entire list , and exchange particular pairs of elements ( adjacent elements or elements with certain step like in shell sorts ) moving toward a more sorted list . merge-based sorts creates initial " naturally " or " unnaturally " sorted sequences , and then add either one element ( insertion sort ) or merge two already sorted sequences . tree-based sorts store the data , at least conceptually , in a binary tree ; there are two different approaches , one based on heaps , and the other based on search trees. finally , the other category catches sorts which use additional key-value information , such as radix or bucket sort. see also postman sort we can also classify sorting algorithms by several other criteria : computational complexity ( worst , average and best number of comparisons for several typical test cases , see below ) in terms of the size of the list ( n ) . typically , good average number of comparisons is o ( n log n ) and bad is o ( n 2 ) . please note that o matters. even if both algorithms belong to n log n class , algorithm for which o = 1 is 100 times faster then algorithm for which o = 100 . another problem with o notation is that this asymptotic analysis does not tell about algorithms behavior on small lists or worst case behavior : worst case behavior is probably more important then average. for example " plain-vanilla " quicksort requires o ( n 2 ) comparisons in case of already sorted arrays : a very important in practice case. sort algorithms which only use generic key comparison operation always need at least o ( n log n ) comparisons on average ; while sort algorithms which exploit the structure of the key space can not sort faster than o ( n log k ) where k is the size of the keyspace. please note that the number of comparison is just convenient theoretical metric. in reality both moves and comparisons matter and failed comparisons matter more then successful ; also on short keys the cost of move is comparable to the cost of successful comparison ( even if pointers are used ) . stability : stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys. if all keys are different the this distinction does not make any sense. but if there are equal keys , then a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records r and s with the same key and with r appearing before s in the original list , r will appear before s in the sorted list. among simple algorithms bubble sort and insertion sort are stable. among complex algorithms mergesort is stable . memory usage ( and use of other computer resources ) . one large class of algorithms are " in-place sorting. they are generally slower than algorithms that use additional memory : additional memory can be used for mapping of keyspace. most fast stable algorithms use additional memory. with the current 4g typical memory size on laptops and 16g typical memory size on the servers as well as virtual memory used in all major oses , the old emphasis on algorithms that does not require additional memory should probably be abandoned. speedup that can be achieved by using of a small amount of additional memory is considerable and it is stupid to ignore it . moreover you can always use pointers and then additional space of the size n actually becomes size of n pointers. in real life sorting records usually are size several times bigger then the size of a pointers ( 4 bytes in 32 bit cpus , 8 bytes on 64 bit ) and that makes methods that use additional space much more acceptable then they look from purely theoretical considerations . locality of reference. in modern computer multi-level memory is used . cache-aware versions of the sort algorithms , whose operations have been specifically chosen to minimize the movement of pages in and out cache , can be dramatically quicker. one example is the tiled merge sort algorithm which stops partitioning subarrays when subarrays of size s are reached , where s is the number of data items fitting into a single page in memory. each of these subarrays is sorted with an in-place sorting algorithm , to discourage memory swaps , and normal merge sort is then completed in the standard recursive fashion. this algorithm has demonstrated better performance on machines that benefit from cache optimization . ( lamarca & ladner 1997 ) minimal number of non-linear execution sequences. modern cpus designs try to minimize wait states of cpu that are inevitable due to the fact that it is connected to much slower ( often 3 or more times ) memory using a variety of techniques such as cpu caches , instruction pipelines , instruction prefetch , branch prediction . for example , the number of instruction pipeline ( see also classic risc pipeline - wikipedia ) flushes ( misses ) on typical data greatly influence the speed of algorithm execution. modern cpu typically use branch prediction ( for example the intel core i7 has two branch target buffers and possibly two or more branch predictors ) . if branch guessed incorrectly penalty is significant and proportional to the number of stages in the pipeline. so one possible optimization of code strategy for modern cpus is reordering branches , so that higher probability code was located after the branch instruction. this is a difficult optimization that requires thorously instrumentation of algorithms and its profiling , gathering set of statistics about branching behaviors based on relevant data samples as well as some compiler pragma to implement it. in any case this is important factor for modern cpus which have 7 , 10 and even 20 stages pipelines ( like in the intel pentium 4 ) and were cost of a pipeline miss can cost as much as three or fours instructions executed sequentially. the difference between worst case and average behavior . for example , quicksort is efficient only on the average , and its worst case is n 2 , while heapsort has an interesting property that the worst case is not much different from the an average case. behaviors on practically important data sets such as completely sorted ( you will be surprised how many sorting operations are performed on already sorted data , inversely sorted and 'almost sorted ' ( 1 to k permutations , where k is less then n/10 ) . the latter is often used as a perverted way of inserting one or two records into a large data set : instead of merging them they are added to the bottom and the whole dataset is sorted. those has tremendous practical implications which are often not addressed or addressed incorrectly in textbooks that devote some pages to sorting . among non-stable algorithms heapsort and shellsort are probably the most underappreciated and quicksort is one of the most overhyped. please note the quicksort is a fragile algorithm that is not that good is using predictive execution of instructions in pipeline ( typical feature of modern cpus ) . it is fradgile because the choice of pivot is equal to guessing an important property of the data to be sorted ( and if it went wrong the performance can be close to quadratic ) . there is also some evidence that on very large sets quicksort runs into " suboptimal partitioning " on a regular basis , so it becomes a feature , not a bug. it does not work well on already sorted or " almost sorted " ( with a couple or permutations ) data as well as data sorted in a reverse order . it does not work well on data that contain a lot of identical keys. those are important cases that are frequent in real world usage of sorting. again i would like to stress that one will be surprised to find what percentage of sorting is performed on already sorted datasets or datasets with less then 10 % of permutations. for those ( and not only for those ; - ) reasons you need to be skeptical about " quicksort lobby " with robert sedgewick ( at least in the past ) as the main cheerleader. quicksort is a really elegant algorithm invented by hoare in 1961 , but in real life other qualities then elegance and speed of random data are more valuable ; - ) . on important practical case of " semi-sorted " and " almost reverse sorted " data quicksort is far from being optimal and often demonstrates dismal performance. you need to do some experiments to see how horrible quicksort can be in case of already sorted data ( simple variants exhibit quadratic behavior , the fact that is not mentioned in many textbooks on the subject ) and how good shellsort is ; - ) . and on typical corporate data heapsort usually beats quicksort because performance of quicksort too much depends of the choice of pivot and series of bad choices increase time considerably. each time the pivot element is close to minimum ( or maximum ) the performance of this stage goes into the drain and on large sets such degenerative cases are not that uncommon and can happen in series ( i suspect that some bad series are " self-created " -- in other words quicksort poisons its data during sorting making bad choices of pivot progressively more probable ) . here are results from one contrarian article written by paul hsieh in 2004 athlon xp 1.620ghz power4 1ghz intel c/c + + /o2 /g6 /qaxi /qxi /qip watcom c/c + + /otexan /6r gcc -o3 -march = athlon-xp msvc /o2 /ot /og /g6 cc -o3 heapsort 2.09 4.06 4.16 4.12 16.91 quicksort 2.58 3.24 3.42 2.80 14.99 mergesort 3.51 4.28 4.83 4.01 16.90 data is time in seconds taken to sort 10000 lists of varying size of about 3000 integers each . download test here please note that total time while important does not tell you the whole story . actually it reveals that using intel compiler heapsort can beat quicksort even " on average " -- not a small feat. you need also know the standard deviation . actually one need to read volume 3 of knuth to appreciate the beauty and complexity of some advanced sorting algorithms. please note that sorting algorithms published in textbooks are more often then not implemented with errors. even insertion sort presents a serious challenge to many book authors. sometimes the author does not know the programming language he/she uses well , sometimes details of the algorithm are implemented incorrectly. and it is not that easy to debug them. in this sense knuth remains " the reference " , one of the few books where the author took a great effort to debug each and every algorithm he presented . please take any predictions about relative efficiency of algorithms with the grain of salt unless they are provided for at least a dozen typical sets of data as described below. shallow authors usually limit themselves to random sets , which are of little practical importance. so please do not spend much time browsing web references below. they are not as good as knuth 's volume.. . in order to judge suitability of a sorting algorithms to a particular application you need to see : are the data that application needs to sort tend to have some preexisting order ? what are properties of keyspace ? do you need a stable sort ? can you use some " extra " memory or need " in-place " soft ? ( with the current computer memory sizes you usually can afford some additional memory so " in-place " algorithms no longer have any advantages ) . generally the more we know about the properties of data to be sorted , the faster we can sort them. as we already mentioned the size of key space is one of the most important dimensions ( sort algorithms that use the size of key space can sort any sequence for time o ( n log k ) ) . for example if we are sorting subset of a card deck we can take into account that there are only 52 keys in any input sequence and select an algorithms that uses limited keyspace for dramatic speeding of the sorting. in this case using generic sorting algorithm is just a waist . moreover , the relative speed of the algorithms depends on the size of the data set : one algorithm can be faster then the other for sorting less then , say , 64 or 128 items and slower on larger sequences. simpler algorithms with minimal housekeeping tend to perform better on small sets even if the are o ( n 2 ) type of algorithms. especially algorithms that have less number of jump statement in compiled version of code. for example insertion sort is competitive with more complex algorithms up to n = 25 or so . typical data sequences for testing sorting algorithms there is not " best sorting algorithm " for all data. various algorithms have their own strength and weaknesses. for example some " sense " already sorted or " almost sorted " data sequences and perform faster on such sets. in this sense knuth math analysis is insufficient althouth " worst time " estimates are useful . as for input data it is useful to distinguish between the following broad categories that all should be used in testing ( random number sorting is a very artificial test and as such the estimate it provides does not have much practical value , unless we know that other cases behave similarly or better ) : completely randomly reshuffled array ( this is the only test that naive people use in evaluating sorting algorithms ) . already sorted array ( you need to see how horrible quicksort is on this case and how good shellsort is ; - ) . this is actually a pretty important case as often sorting is actually resorting of previously sorted data done after minimal modifications of the data set. there are three imortant case of already sorted array array of distinct elements sorted in " right " direction for which no any reordering is required ( triangular array ) . already sorted array consisting of small number of identical elements ( stairs ) . the worst case is retangular array in when single element is present ( all values are identical ) . already sorted in reverse order array ( many algorithms , such as insertion sort work slow on such an array ) array that consisted of merged already sorted arrays ( chainsaw array ) . arrays can be sorted in right direction in opposite direction of have arrays both sorted in right and opposite direction ( one case is " symmetrical chainsaw " ) . array consisting of small number of identical elements ( sometimes called or " few unique " case ) . if number of distinct elements is large this is the case similar to chainsaw but without advantage of preordering. so it can be generated by " inflicting " certain number of permutations on chainsaw array. worst case is when there is just two values of elements in the array ( binary array ) . quicksort is horrible on such data. many other algorithms work slow on such an array . already sorted in right direction array with n permutations ( with n from 0.1 to 10 % of the size ) . insrtion soft does well on such arrays. shellsort also is quick. quick sort do not adapt well to nearly sorted data . already sorted array in reverse order array with n permutations large data sets with normal distribution of keys . pseudorandom data ( daily values of s&p500 or other index for a decade or two might be a good test set here ; they are available from yahoo.com ) behavior on " almost sorted " data and worst case behavior are a very important characteristics of sorting algorithms. for example , in sorting n objects , merge sort has an average and worst-case performance of o ( n log n ) . if the input is already sorted , its complexity falls to o ( n ) . specifically , n-1 comparisons and zero moves are performed , which is the same as for simply running through the input , checking if it is pre-sorted. in perl 5.8 , merge sort is its default sorting algorithm ( it was quicksort in previous versions of perl ) . python uses timsort , a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort , which will become the standard sort algorithm for java se 7 . languages for exploring the efficiency of sort algorithms calculation of the number of comparisons and number of data moves can be done in any language. c and other compiled languages provide an opportunity to see the effect of computer instruction set and cpu speed on the sorting performance . usually the test program is written as a subroutine that is called , say , 1000 times . then data entry time ( running just data coping or data generating part the same number of times without any sorting ) is subtracted from the first. that method can provide more or less accurate estimate of actual algorithms run time on a particular data set and particular cpu architecture. generally cpus that have a lot of general purpose registers tend to perform better on sorting : sorting algorithms tend to belong to the class with tight inner loop and speed of this inner loop has disproportionate effect on the total run time. if many variables of this inner look can be kept in registers times improves considerably. artificial computers like knuth mixx can be used too. in this case the time is calculated based on the time table of performing of each instruction ( instruction cost metric ) . you can use perl or other interpreted language in a similar way please note that a lot of examples in the books are implemented with errors. that 's especially true for java books and java demo implementations . top updates your browser does not support iframes . bulletin latest past week past month google search news contents a comparison of sorting algorithms the heroic tales of sorting algorithms sorting knuth the code project - sorting algorithms in c # - c # programming richard harter 's world postman 's sort article from c users journal an improved comb sort with pre-defined gap table pennysort is a measure of how many 100-byte records you can sort for a penny of capital cost 4 programs make nt 'sort ' of fast fast median search an ansi c implementation an inverted taxonomy of sorting algorithms data structures and algorithms with object-oriented design patterns in c + + sortchk - a sort algorithm test suite sorting algorithms old news ; - ) a comparison of sorting algorithms not clear how the data were compiled... code is amateurish so timing should be taken with the grain of salt . recently , i have translated a variety of sorting routines into visual basic and compared their performance... i hope you will find the code for these sorts useful and interesting . what makes a good sorting algorithm ? speed is probably the top consideration , but other factors of interest include versatility in handling various data types , consistency of performance , memory requirements , length and complexity of code , and the property of stability ( preserving the original order of records that have equal keys ) . as you may guess , no single sort is the winner in all categories simultaneously ( table 2 ) . let 's start with speed , which breaks down into " order " and " overhead " . when we talk about the order of a sort , we mean the relationship between the number of keys to be sorted and the time required. the best case is o ( n ) ; time is linearly proportional to the number of items. we ca n't do this with any sort that works by comparing keys ; the best such sorts can do is o ( n log n ) , but we can do it with a radixsort , which does n't use comparisons. many simple sorts ( bubble , insertion , selection ) have o ( n ^ 2 ) behavior , and should never be used for sorting long lists. but what about short lists ? the other part of the speed equation is overhead resulting from complex code , and the sorts that are good for long lists tend to have more of it. for short lists of 5 to 50 keys or for long lists that are almost sorted , insertion-sort is extremely efficient and can be faster than finishing the same job with quicksort or a radixsort. many of the routines in my collection are " hybrids " , with a version of insertionsort finishing up after a fast algorithm has done most of the job. the third aspect of speed is consistency. some sorts always take the same amount of time , but many have " best case " and " worst case " performance for particular input orders of keys. a famous example is quicksort , generally the fastest of the o ( n log n ) sorts , but it always has an o ( n ^ 2 ) worst case. it can be tweaked to make this worst case very unlikely to occur , but other o ( n log n ) sorts like heapsort and mergesort remain o ( n log n ) in their worst cases. quicksort will almost always beat them , but occasionally they will leave it in the dust.

asymptotic complexities straight insertion 495 on each pass the current item is inserted into the sorted section of the list. it starts with the last position of the sorted list , and moves backwards until it finds the proper place of the current item. that item is then inserted into that place , and all items after that are shuffled to the left to accommodate it. it is for this reason , that if the list is already sorted , then the sorting would be o ( n ) because every element is already in its sorted position. if however the list is sorted in reverse , it would take o ( n 2 ) time as it would be searching through the entire sorted section of the list each time it does an insertion , and shuffling all other elements down the list. . good for nearly sorted lists , very bad for out of order lists , due to the shuffling . insertion yes best case : o ( n ) . worst case : o ( n 2 ) binary insertion sort 497 this is an extension of the straight insertion as above , however instead of doing a linear search each time for the correct position , it does a binary search , which is o ( log n ) instead of o ( n ) . the only problem is that it always has to do a binary search even if the item is in its current position. this brings the cost of the best cast up to o ( n log n ) . due to the possibility of having to shuffle all other elements down the list on each pass , the worst case running time remains at o ( n 2 ) . this is better than the strait insertion if the comparisons are costly. this is because even though , it always has to do log n comparisons , it would generally work out to be less than a linear search . insertion yes best case : o ( n log n ) . worst case : o ( n 2 ) bubble sort 499 on each pass of the data , adjacent elements are compared , and switched if they are out of order. eg. e 1 with e 2 , then e 2 with e 3 and so on . this means that on each pass , the largest element that is left unsorted , has been " bubbled " to its rightful place at the end of the array. however , due to the fact that all adjacent out of order pairs are swapped , the algorithm could be finished sooner. preiss claims that it will always take o ( n 2 ) time because it keeps sorting even if it is in order , as we can see , the algorithm does n't recognise that. now someone with a bit more knowledge than preiss will obviously see , that you can end the algorithm in the case when no swaps were made , thereby making the best case o ( n ) ( when it is already sorted ) and worst case still at o ( n 2 ) . in general this is better than insertion sort i believe , because it has a good change of being sorted in much less than o ( n 2 ) time , unless you are a blind preiss follower . exchange yes . note : preiss uses a bad algorithm , and claims that best and worst case is o ( n 2 ) . we however using a little bit of insight , can see that the following is correct of a better bubble sort algorithm ( which does peake agree with ? ) best case : o ( n ) . worst case : o ( n 2 ) quicksort 501 i strongly recommend looking at the diagram for this one. the code is also useful and provided below ( included is the selectpivot method even though that probably wo n't help you understanding anyway ) . the quick sort operates along these lines : firstly a pivot is selected , and removed from the list ( hidden at the end ) . then the elements are partitioned into 2 sections. one which is less than the pivot , and one that is greater. this partitioning is achieved by exchanging values . then the pivot is restored in the middle , and those 2 sections are recursively quick sorted . a complicated but effective sorting algorithm . exchange no best case : o ( n log n ) . worst case : o ( n 2 ) refer to page 506 for more information about these values. note : preiss on page 524 says that the worst case is o ( n log n ) contradicting page 506 , but i believe that it is o ( n 2 ) , as per page 506 . straight selection sorting . 511 this one , although not very efficient is very simply. basically , it does n 2 linear passes on the list , and on each pass , it selects the largest value , and swaps it with the last unsorted element . this means that it is n't stable , because for example a 3 could be swapped with a 5 that is to the left of a different 3 . a very simple algorithm , to code , and a very simple one to explain , but a little slow. note that you can do this using the smallest value , and swapping it with the first unsorted element . selection no unlike the bubble sort this one is truly q ( n 2 ) , where best case and worst case are the same , because even if the list is sorted , the same number of selections must still be performed . heap sort 513 this uses a similar idea to the straight selection sorting , except , instead of using a linear search for the maximum , a heap is constructed , and the maximum can easily be removed ( and the heap reformed ) in log n time. this means that you will do n passes , each time doing a log n remove maximum , meaning that the algorithm will always run in q ( n log n ) time , as it makes no difference the original order of the list . this utilises , just about the only good use of heaps , that is finding the maximum element , in a max heap ( or the minimum of a min heap ) . is in every way as good as the straight selection sort , but faster . selection no best case : o ( n log n ) . worst case : o ( n log n ) . ok , now i know that looks tempting , but for a much more programmer friendly solution , look at merge sort instead , for a better o ( n log n ) sort . 2 way merge sort 519 it is fairly simple to take 2 sorted lists , and combine the into another sorted list , simply by going through , comparing the heads of each list , removing the smallest to join the new sorted list. as you may guess , this is an o ( n ) operation . with 2 way sorting , we apply this method to an single unsorted list . in brief , the algorithm recursively splits up the array until it is fragmented into pairs of two single element arrays. each of those single elements is then merged with its pairs , and then those pairs are merged with their pairs and so on , until the entire list is united in sorted order. noting that if there is every an odd number , an extra operation is added , where it is added to one of the pairs , so that that particular pair will have 1 more element than most of the others , and wo n't have any effect on the actual sorting . now is n't this much easier to understand that heap sort , its really quite intuitive. this one is best explain with the aid of the diagram , and if you have n't already , you should look at it . merge yes best and worst case : q ( n log n ) bucket sort 526 bucket sort initially creates a " counts " array whose size is the size of the range of all possible values for the data we are sorting , eg. all of the values could be between 1 and 100 , therefore the array would have 100 elements. 2 passes are then done on the list. the first tallies up the occurrences of each of number into the " counts " array. that is for each index of the array , the data that it contains signifies the number of times that number occurred in list. the second and final pass goes though the counts array , regenerating the list in sorted form. so if there were 3 instance of 1 , 0 of 2 , and 1 of 3 , the sorted list would be recreated to 1,1,1,3 . this diagram will most likely remove all shadows of doubt in your minds . this sufferers a limitation that radix does n't , in that if the possible range of your numbers is very high , you would need too many " buckets " and it would be impractical . the other limitation that radix does n't have , that this one does is that stability is not maintained. it does however outperform radix sort if the possible range is very small . distribution no best and worst case : q ( m + n ) where m is the number of possible values. obviously this is o ( n ) for most values of m , so long as m is n't too large. the reason that these distribution sorts break the o ( n log n ) barrier is because no comparisons are performed ! radix sort 528 this is an extremely spiffy implementation of the bucket sort algorithm. this time , several bucket like sorts are performed ( one for each digit ) , but instead of having a counts array representing the range of all possible values for the data , it represents all of the possible values for each individual digit , which in decimal numbering is only 10. firstly a bucked sort is performed , using only the least significant digit to sort it by , then another is done using the next least significant digit , until the end , when you have done the number of bucket sorts equal to the maximum number of digits of your biggest number. because with the bucket sort , there are only 10 buckets ( the counts array is of size 10 ) , this will always be an o ( n ) sorting algorithm ! see below for a radix example. on each of the adapted bucket sorts it does , the count array stores the numbers of each digit. then the offsets are created using the counts , and then the sorted array regenerated using the offsets and the original data . this is the god of sorting algorithms. it will search the largest list , with the biggest numbers , and has a is guaranteed o ( n ) time complexity. and it ai n't very complex to

searching . descriptions are brief and intuitive , with just enough theory thrown in to make you nervous. i assume you know a high-level language , such as c , and that you are familiar with programming concepts including arrays and pointers . the first section introduces basic data structures and notation. the next section presents several sorting algorithms. this is followed by a section on dictionaries , structures that allow efficient insert , search , and delete operations. the last section describes algorithms that sort data and implement dictionaries for very large files. source code for each algorithm , in ansi c , is included . most algorithms have also been coded in visual basic . if you are programming in visual basic , i recommend you read visual basic collections and hash tables , for an explanation of hashing and node representation . if you are interested in translating this document to another language , please send me email. special thanks go to pavel
