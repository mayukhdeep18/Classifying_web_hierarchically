edit terms.intro.m4 not terms.intro dictionary of algorithms and data structures this web site is hosted by the software and systems division , information technology laboratory , nist in collaboration with the fastar group . development of this dictionary started in 1998 under the editorship of paul e. black . this is a dictionary of algorithms , algorithmic techniques , data structures , archetypal problems , and related definitions . algorithms include common functions , such as ackermann 's function . problems include traveling salesman and byzantine generals . some entries have links to implementations and more information . index pages list entries by area and by type . the two-level index has a total download 1/20 as big as this page . do n't use this site to cheat. teachers , contact us if we can help . currently we do not include algorithms particular to business data processing , communications , operating systems or distributed algorithms , programming languages , ai , graphics , or numerical analysis : it is tough enough covering " general " algorithms and data structures . entries without definitions link here if you have suggestions , corrections , or comments , please get in touch with paul black . some terms with a leading variable , such as n -way , m -dimensional , or p -branching , are under k - . you may find useful entries in a glossary of computer oriented abbreviations and acronyms . to look up words or phrases , enter them in the box , then click the button . google safesearch web dads google safesearch a b c d e f g h i j k l m n

, illustrated definitions , and ratings of sites with implementations . data structures and algorithms is a wonderful site with illustrations , explanations , analysis , and code taking the student from arrays and lists through trees , graphs , and intractable problems . eric weisstein 's world of mathematics or mathworld . the sphere online judge ( spoj ) has about 6600 small programming tasks or puzzles and 900 contests. even nicer it automatically assesses your programs written in 40 languages . the computing research repository ( corr ) . seventh international conference on fun with algorithms ( fun 2014 ) . the conference " is dedicated to the use , design , and analysis of algorithms and data structures , focusing on results that provide amusing , witty but nonetheless original and scientifically profound contributions to the area.
