we do the math so you do n't have to ! random number generation anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is , of course , in a state of sin . john von neumann ( 1951 ) here is information on pseudo and quasi random number generation with implementations in several languages. an a tutorial on how to generate nonuniformly distributed random numbers . forth dimensions ( 1994 , xvi nos 1 & 2 ) review article on random numbers ( tar.z or tar.gz formats ) . contains r250 and quasi in ( f-pc ) forth . a reference list of papers . note on generating gaussian/normal random numbers ( or other nonuniform distributions ) . a monte carlo method reference list . a bestiary of random distributions . pseudo-random number generation using r250 ( kirkpatrick and stoll , 1981 ) . ada implementation . c implementation ( shell archive , tar archive ) . c + + implementation ( shell archive , gnu compressed tar archive ) . ans forth implementation . fortran implementation java implementation . note : r250 is an example of a shift register generator. this one has a register length of 250 which results in a period of 2 ^ 249. the code provide here can easily be modifed for other register lengths. the following two papers describe the parameters that are needed for lengths from 1 to 1000 : zierler , n. and j. brillhart,1968 ; on primitive trinomials ( mod 2 ) , information and control , vol 13 no 6 ( dec ) , pp. 541 - 554 zierler , n. and j. brillhart,1969 ; on primitive trinomials ( mod 2 ) ii , information and control , vol 14 no 6 ( jun ) , pp. 566 - 569 warning : r250 requires the use of a separate random number generator in order to intialize itself. it can fail spectacularly if the initialization is poorly done. i have had reliable results using the park and miller " minimal standard " generator for the initializer. the above implementations use this initializer ( which is included in the source code ) . the ranlux portable pseudorandom generator original paper and implementation report . a site with isaac and related generators plus analyses and tests . quasi-random number generation ( press and teukolsky , 1989 ) . ada implementation . c implementation ( shell archive , tar archive ) . c + + implementation ( shell archive , tar archive ) . ans forth implementation . george marsaliga 's mother of all pseudo-random-number-generators .
