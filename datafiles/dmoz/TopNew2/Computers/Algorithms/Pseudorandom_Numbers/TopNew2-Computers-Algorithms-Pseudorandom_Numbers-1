distributions this page contains software libraries for some very good random number generators . the basic random number generators make floating point or integer random numbers with uniform distributions . this code is available in c + + language and as binary function libraries for several different platforms . the non-uniform random number generators make random variates with several different distributions. this code is available in c + + language . code examples are included , showing how to use these software libraries . all code is provided with open source under the gnu general public license . these generators are intended for monte carlo applications , not for cryptographic applications . download packages : uniform random number generators in c + + description : c + + class library containing the following random number generators : mersenne twister , sfmt and mother-of-all. can generate floating point or integer random numbers with uniform distribution , and random bits. very good randomness , high resolution , extremely long cycle lengths , and high speed. supports multi-threaded applications. examples included . system requirements : any c + + compiler , any operating system . further description and instructions file name : randomc.zip , size : 471048 , last modified : 2014-jun-14 . download c + + random number generators . uniform random number generators as binary libraries description : contains the same random number generators as the abovementioned c + + package , but implemented as binary libraries in * .lib , * .dll and * .a files. coded in assembly language for optimal speed . supports many different compilers and operating systems , including 32-bit and 64-bit windows , linux , bsd and intel-based mac . system requirements : any x86 or x86-64 platform . can be called from compiled languages such as c and c + + . further description and instructions file name : asmlib.zip , size : 891518 , last modified : 2014-jul-30 . download random number generator binary libraries . non-uniform random number generators in c + + description : c + + class library generating random numbers with the following distributions : normal , truncated normal , bernoulli , poisson , binomial , hypergeometric , wallenius ' and fisher 's noncentral hypergeometric , multinomial , multivariate hypergeometric , and multivariate fisher 's and wallenius ' noncentral hypergeometric distributions . a function for shuffling numbers is also provided . includes c + + examples showing how to use these functions for simulating evolution and for other purposes . most of the functions are fast and accurate , even for extreme values of the parameters . you have the choice of using any of the uniform random number generators in the above c + +
