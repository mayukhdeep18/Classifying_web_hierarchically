created by amir said , 19-jan-1996 spiht image compression with set partitioning in hierarchical trees welcome to the www home page that describes set partitioning in hierarchical trees ( spiht ) : the award-winning wavelet-based image compression method. the method also compresses video and medical/biological signals very efficiently . we utilize this homepage as a general resource for signal compression , so will make available programs other than spiht . ! new spiht in matlab now available is a fast arithmetic coding algorithm , called fastac , authored by amir said. for informtion read information about fastac for more extensive information and downloads , go to the url fastac . information about spiht properties of the method licensing information demo programs/downloads books and papers demo images faq technical discussion www image compression resources spiht megasave --------------------- horizontal rule ---------------------- feedback please take a few seconds to sign our guest book ( and maybe add some comments ) . if you want more information about spiht , or any of our programs ; find that one of our www pages has an incorrect link ; find a bug in the programs , or a typo in the papers ; want to show us your results or tell us your opinion ; please send us an e-mail . amir said : said @ ieee.org william a. pearlman : pearlw @ ecse.rpi.edu --------------------- horizontal rule ---------------------- these pages are being served from the center for image processing research ( cipr ) at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ( rpi ) . spiht last updated : november 4 , 2013 -------------------- end of file spiht0 --------------------
