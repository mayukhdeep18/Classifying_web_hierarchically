" the quote has 17 words , made up of 61 letters , 16 spaces , one dash and one period. if each letter , space or punctuation mark takes up one unit of memory , we get a total file size of 79 units. to get the file size down , we need to look for redundancies. immediately , we notice that : " ask " appears two times " what " appears two times " your " appears two times " country " appears two times " can " appears two times " do " appears two times " for " appears two times " you " appears two times ignoring the difference between capital and lower-case letters , roughly half of the phrase is redundant. nine words -- ask , not , what , your , country , can , do , for , you -- give us almost everything we need for the entire quote. to construct the second half of the phrase , we just point to the words in the first half and fill in the spaces and punctuation. we 'll look at how file-compression systems deal with redundancy in more detail in the next section . print cite this ! close please copy/paste the following text to properly cite this howstuffworks article : harris , tom.
