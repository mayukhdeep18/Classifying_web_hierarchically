pattern matching pointers combinatorial pattern matching addresses issues of searching and matching strings and more complicated patterns such as trees , regular expressions , graphs , point sets , and arrays. the goal is to derive non-trivial combinatorial properties for such structures and then to exploit these properties in order to achieve improved performance for the corresponding computational problem . a steady flow of high-quality research on this subject has changed a sparse set of isolated results into a full-fledged area of algorithmics with important applications. this area is expected to grow even further due to the increasing demand for speed and efficiency that comes from molecular biology , but also from areas such as information retrieval , pattern recognition , compiling , data compression , program analysis and security . disclaimer : the purpose of this page is to serve as an index to information relevant to pattern matching/computational biologist researchers. we prefer to point to information rather than store it locally. we include all submissions that seem appropriate . however , inclusion should not be interpreted as an endorsement of a
